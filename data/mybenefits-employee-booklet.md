Your employee booklet

For employees participating in the Canadian benefit program

myBenefits is a key part of your Total Rewards package, providing valuable coverage and the flexibility and choice to meet your diverse needs.

# Your benefits, your options, your choices?

At Techcom, your health and well-being are important to us. That’s why we are committed to providing a modern and flexible benefits program – one that supports you and your family's entire well-being.

That’s where the myBenefits program comes in. A key part of your Total Rewards package, the program is designed to:

- support you and your family’s overall well-being, including your physical, mental and emotional health and well-being;
- offer enhanced Core benefits that address a broader variety of needs; and
- be easy to understand.

Even better, the myBenefits program puts the choice in your hands. You pick the benefits that are right for you and your family. This booklet is designed to help you do just that. It provides a comprehensive overview of the program.

More specifically:

1. It will help you make informed benefit selections about which plans and which benefit levels give you and your family the protection you want and/or need.
2. It will help you compare coverage under the myBenefits program against coverage available outside the program (e.g., under your spouse’s/partner’s plan).
3. It will serve as a comprehensive reference guide. It will help you understand how the program works and what your benefit options are. This booklet will also help you determine, for example, what you can and cannot claim under the program.

We suggest that you review this booklet carefully before making your benefit selections. We also suggest that you keep it for future reference.

The myBenefits program is designed to help meet your benefit needs throughout what we hope will be a rewarding career with Techcom. To take full advantage of this program, however, you need to make some important decisions.

Your benefits, your options, your choices.

Benefit plans may change or terminate

Techcom and its subsidiaries reserve the unilateral right to change, amend or terminate the coverage or contracts and/or policy documents underlying the coverage at any time, and may be required to do so because of changes to legislation.

In addition, Techcom also reserves the right at any time to amend the terms and conditions of the various coverages, as well as the amount charged to the individual.

# How it works

myBenefits gives you the flexibility you need to design a personalized benefit program that’s right for you and your family.

Each plan year, you will receive an allotment of credits. In addition to _Basic credits_, you may be entitled to _Dependent credits_. Dependent credits will be allotted if you select dependant coverage. Your total credits are intended to help you select coverage based on your family status.

You choose your benefit options

You can use your credits together with payroll deductions, if necessary, to pay for your benefit options.

Earn Wellness credits

You have the opportunity to earn up to $300 in _Wellness credits_ annually. These credits are awarded for your participation in certain activities each year. Wellness credits are deposited into your Wellness Account.

All remaining credits can be directed to your Health Spending Account, your Wellness Account and/or your RRSP through RESSOP/DSSP

Credits are used to purchase medical and dental services/products not covered by the benefit selections you choose. Wellness credits are used for wellness-related expenses. For RRSP, amount is limited to excess Basic credits only.

Some benefit options must be paid for via payroll deductions.

Benefits Base and Benefit Earnings

Coverage for certain benefits (e.g., Basic and Optional Life insurance) is based on your benefit earnings and/or your benefit base. As a result, it’s important to know what these two terms mean.

Your **benefit base** equals either:

1. your current salary; or
2. if you are on an average earnings formula, the average of your eligible earnings for the two previous calendar years, including salary/draw and any regular, ongoing variable pay (e.g., commissions, IA bonus) as designated in your compensation structure/plan and approved by Corporate Compensation.

For new hires or employees with less than two years of service, benefit base will be calculated as follows:

1st calendar year – as defined in your offer of employment; 2nd calendar year – the greater of:

your prior year’s benefit base; your prior year’s earnings;

your prior year’s earnings plus your current benefit base divided by two; or the minimum of the position compensation band, if applicable.

Benefit base excludes any annual or year-end incentive(s)/bonus, or other specified incentives.

Your **benefit earnings** equal your benefit base as defined in either

1. or b) above plus your eligible short term incentive(s) from the previous year.

#### Employee - paid Optional benefits – Employee and / or Eligible dependants

Note: All maximums are per covered person and are based on when the claim was incurred, not submitted. A covered person refers to you and any eligible dependant(s) for whom you have elected coverage. The plan year is July 1 to June 30.

1 Services of a chiropractor, osteopath, naturopath, dietitian, podiatrist, chiropodist, acupuncturist, massage therapist, orthotherapist and audiologist.

Paramedical and Vision Plan

In addition to your company-paid Core benefits, the **myBenefits** program gives you the flexibility to select your preferred benefits from a wide range of options. Each of these optional plans is outlined in the following sections.

Changing your Benefit Level or Class of Coverage

You can always increase your benefit level or class of coverage during the Annual Enrolment Period (AEP) or at any time of year if you experience a qualifying change event (see _Eligible change event_ [on](#bookmark18) page 13 for more information). Keep in mind that the **myBenefits** plan year runs from July 1 to June 30 of each year.

# Eligibility and important information?

This booklet contains important information regarding your myBenefits

program coverage and, therefore, should be kept in a safe place.

Eligibility

You are eligible to participate in the myBenefits program if you participate in a Canadian-dollar benefit program, are an employee of a member company of Techcom, and are:

- a continuous employee who works a minimum of 15 hours per week (i.e., a salaried employee with an ongoing regular work arrangement); or
- an intermittent employee who is a member of the pension plan and has met the minimum earnings criteria (i.e., has earned at least 35% of the Year’s Maximum Pensionable Earnings in each of the two preceding calendar years, excluding overtime, vacation pay and eligible incentives). For the year 2023, the YMPE is $66,600 (the earnings criteria must be met each year to qualify for continued coverage); and
- covered under a provincial healthcare plan\*; and
- residing in Canada\*.
  Intermittent employees already eligible for benefits must pass an earnings test each calendar year to continue benefits the following plan year. For example, an intermittent employee must earn at least $21,560 in 2021 and $22,715 in 2022 to continue benefits after July 1, 2023. For 2023, an intermittent employee must earn at least $23,310 to continue benefits after July 1, 2024.
  Grandfathering rules apply to employees who worked less than 15 hours per week prior to January 1, 2002, and continue in the work arrangement. This provision is in place until further notice.
  Once you meet the eligibility requirements, you may enrol using the myBenefits Enrolment System available from
  myHR > Benefits & Life Changes > Benefits. If you do not enrol within 60 days of your eligibility date, you will be automatically enrolled in Core coverage only. If you do not enrol during the annual enrolment period, you will be enrolled automatically in the same options you selected for the previous year (subject to new price tags and credits).
  Any excess credits will be deposited into your Health Spending Account and your coverage will remain in effect until the start date of the next plan year. You may be required to provide evidence of insurability (EOI) if you want to increase certain coverage(s) at a later date.
  Covering your family
  Benefit plans are not just about you; they are also about your family. That’s why the myBenefits program allows you to extend coverage to your family under the Paramedical and Vision, Drugs and Medical, Dental, Life, Accidental Death & Dismemberment and Critical Illness Insurance Plans.
  Under the Paramedical and Vision, Drugs and Medical, and Dental Plans, you can select the class of coverage that fits your family circumstances. There are four different classes of coverage:
- Employee Only – Only you will be covered.
- Employee + Spouse – You and your spouse/partner will be covered.
- Employee + Child – You and one eligible dependent child will be covered.
- Employee + 2 or More – You, your spouse/partner and/or eligible dependent children will be covered.

See the next page for the definitions of eligible dependants.

- Except for an expatriate employee (and covered family members) participating in the Canadian myBenefits program.
  Eligible dependants?

  Spouse/partner is defined as:
  The person of the same or opposite sex who is either:

  - legally married to you; or
  - has been living with you in a common-law relationship for at least one year and continues to do so, and whom you publicly represent as your spouse/partner; or
  - has entered into a civil union with you pursuant to Quebec law; and:
  - has coverage under a provincial healthcare plan\*; and
  - is residing in Canada\*.
    A divorced spouse is not eligible for coverage. You can qualify only one person as your spouse/partner at a time.
    dependent child(ren) are defined as:
    You and/or your spouse/partner’s child who is a natural or adopted child:
  - unmarried and dependent on you for support;
  - covered under a provincial healthcare plan\*; and
  - residing in Canada\*; and is:
  - under age 21;\*\* or
  - under age 25,\*\* if attending school full-time at a post-secondary institution, such as a college or university (under 26 for prescription drug coverage in Quebec); or
  - any age, with pre-approval of the plan administrator, if the child:

    - is unmarried, unemployed, and financially dependent on you due to a mental or physical disability; and
    - was disabled before age 21; and
    - was covered under an Techcom benefit plan prior to turning age 21. \* Except for an expatriate employee (and covered family members) participating in the Canadian myBenefits program.
      \*\* If a child becomes disabled while a dependant, these age limits do not apply, provided an extension of coverage beyond the limiting age has been applied for within 60 days and approved by the plan administrator.
      As you might expect, the annual cost for _Employee + Spouse_ and _Employee + Child_ will be higher than _Employee Only_ coverage. Likewise, _Employee + 2 or More_ coverage will be more costly than _Employee + Spouse_ or _Employee + Child_. Keep in mind, however, that you will receive additional credits if you elect dependant coverage.
      You can elect a different class of coverage (Core, Coordination or Comprehensive) for each plan.
      Coordinating claims with your spouse/partner
      If both you and your spouse/partner have health and/or dental coverage under a company-sponsored benefit program, you can coordinate your claims. In other words, you can claim payment for health or dental expenses under both plans.
      In no case can the total reimbursement you (and your spouse/partner) receive exceed 100% of the actual expense you (or your spouse/partner) incurred. With that in mind, you might want to consider reducing your Paramedical and Vision, Drugs and Medical and/or Dental coverage and costs under the myBenefits program if you have coverage under another plan. Reducing your coverage may make sense if the cost of coverage under the myBenefits program would not warrant the additional amounts you can claim on a coordinated basis. For more information, see _Coordinating claims with your spouse/partner_ [on](#bookmark136) page 79.

    Quebec residents – drug coverage requirement
    If you live in Quebec, the law states that you must select a minimum level of drug coverage for you and your eligible dependants (i.e., coverage that is RAMQ\*-compliant), unless you have comparable coverage under another plan. If you select an option that provides less than the minimum level of drug coverage, you will be asked to acknowledge that you have RAMQ-compliant coverage under another plan.
    The law also requires that the group plan must pay at the RAMQ minimum level. Sunlife, Techcom's Drug plan administrator, reimburses the claim based on either the RAMQ level or the level of coverage the employee has elected whichever is closely matched to the RAMQ minimum requirement.
    Coverage for your spouse/partner and/or a dependent child will stop as soon as he or she fails to satisfy the applicable definition. For example, a child will no longer qualify for coverage if he or she gets married, starts full-time employment or exceeds the established age limit(s).
    Changing your benefits
    Each year, during the annual enrolment period, you have the opportunity to change your benefit selections for the following plan year (July 1 to June 30).
    There are, however, exceptions to this rule. You will be allowed to increase or reduce your benefit level and/or class of family coverage at any time of year following:

  - an eligible change event, provided that event changes the make-up of your family (i.e., a marriage, divorce, the qualifying or disqualifying of a spouse/partner, or the birth/adoption of a child); or
  - the loss or gain of coverage under your spouse’s/partner’s plan (e.g., due to a change in your spouse’s/partner’s employment, including your spouse’s/partner’s retirement).
    In addition, if you or your spouse/partner have not used any tobacco-related products (i.e., cigarettes,
    e-cigarettes, vaping products, cigars, patches, chewing tobacco, nicotine gum) in the last 12 months, you or your spouse/ partner can change status from smoker to non-smoker on the myBenefits Enrolment System.
    You cannot increase your coverage under any of the myBenefits plans while on disability leave, unless you experience an eligible change event that affects the make-up of your family (i.e., marriage, divorce, birth of a child, etc.). In this case you may change your class of coverage (e.g., _Employee Only_, _Employee + Spouse_, etc.) within 60 days of the event.

- The Régie de l’assurance maladie du Québec (RAMQ) is a government-based organization that administers different programs in the area of health insurance.

Eligible change event?

You can change certain benefit coverage during the plan year if you experience what is known as an eligible change event. This is a life event that could affect the amount of benefit coverage you need. Eligible change

- return from disability leave, if you were on disability leave during an annual enrolment period
- Canadian expatriate employee returning to Canada

events include:

It is up to you to change your benefit coverage within 60 days of your eligible change event. You must update your coverage using the myBenefits Enrolment System – which can be accessed via myHR. Alternately, if you don’t have access to a computer, you must report the change directly to HR Advice Canada by calling an

HR Advice Representative at 1-800-545-2555.

If you miss the 60-day window, your current selections will remain in effect for the remainder of the plan year.

Evidence of insurability (EOI)

Depending on the selections you make under the myBenefits program, you (and/or your spouse/partner) may be required to provide evidence of insurability (EOI) before some coverage can take effect. This involves submitting forms to the insurance company and providing health information.

The insurance company will review the information and may also require you and/or your spouse/partner to:

- undergo a physical examination,

- submit to certain test results, and/or

- provide other information.

  The following table lists when EOI is required.
  When EOI is required
  New Employee (must enrol within 60 days of benefit eligibility date)
  Optional Employee Life – over 2 times benefit earnings Optional Spousal Life – above the first $25,000
  Critical Illness (employee, spouse/partner) – above the first $75,000
  Annual enrolment (must enrol before start of plan year)
  Optional Employee Life – any new coverage Optional Spousal Life – any new coverage
  Critical Illness (employee, spouse/partner) – any new coverage above the first $75,000
  Eligible Change Event (must request change within 60 days of eligible change event)
  Optional Employee Life – any new coverage over 2 times benefit earnings Optional Spousal Life – any new coverage above the first $25,000
  Critical Illness (employee, spouse/partner) – any new coverage above the first $75,000

  Any coverage for which you are required to submit EOI will _not_ go into effect until your EOI has been approved by the insurance company providing the coverage (see _For more information_ [on](#bookmark143) page 78 for a list of insurers). Premium deductions based on the higher level of coverage will take effect once your EOI has been approved. This may result in premiums being deducted retroactively collected to the approval date. Whether or not your EOI is approved is the exclusive decision of the insurer; Techcom has no say one way or the other.?
  Beneficiaries
  The person or persons you name as your _beneficiary_ (using the Beneficiary Designation form) will receive your Employee Life insurance, as well as any Accidental Death and Dismemberment insurance (AD&D) and/or your Business Travel Accident payable if you die as a result of a covered accident. If you have not named a beneficiary using the Beneficiary Designation form, the benefit will be paid to your estate.
  You are automatically the beneficiary for any Optional Spousal Life or Optional Child(ren) Life insurance payable under the myBenefits program, as well as any Accidental Death & Dismemberment (AD&D) insurance paid on behalf of a covered family member.
  A Beneficiary Designation form is available from the Forms page of myHR > Benefits & Life Changes > Benefits > Forms & Contacts.
  You can update your beneficiaries at any time by completing a new Beneficiary Designation form.
  If you appoint multiple beneficiaries...
  If you appoint more than one person as beneficiary for the same benefit, you can specify what percentage of the benefit each will receive; however, the total must add up to 100%.
  If you want to appoint minor beneficiaries...
  If you wish to designate minor children as beneficiaries, a trustee must be designated. The appointed trustee is to receive any payments on behalf of any beneficiary during his or her minority for the support, maintenance, education and benefit of such beneficiary at the discretion of the trustee. If you name a minor as a beneficiary, they will not have access to any insurance payout until reaching the age of majority – unless you take the necessary legal steps before your death. Those steps vary from province to province. Before naming a minor as beneficiary, you may wish to seek legal advice.
  In Quebec, when a death benefit under a life insurance policy is payable to a minor beneficiary, it must be paid to the parent(s) (or tutor or curator as defined by the Quebec Civil Code, if applicable), and not to anyone else who might be named as administrator/trustee of the proceeds.
  If you live in Quebec and designate your legally married or civil union spouse/partner...
  Under Quebec law, if you designate your legally married or civil union spouse/partner as beneficiary, this designation will be irrevocable unless you specify that it is revocable on the form. If you specify that a designation is revocable, then you can change your beneficiary at any time without the consent of your spouse/partner. To change an irrevocable designation, you will need the written consent of your spouse/partner.

  When designating your beneficiary(ies), keep in mind that the above is for information purposes only. As with any estate planning, you may wish to seek legal advice if you have any questions regarding the designation of beneficiaries in your particular circumstances.
  If you are on approved leave
  You may, with the approval of the company, continue some of your coverage while on an approved leave (e.g., leave protected under employment standards legislation, applicable to you), provided you remain in Canada. While on approved leave other than Short Term Disability (STD) or Basic Long Term Disability (LTD):

- your Core coverage will continue at no cost to you,

- you must continue to pay your premiums for any Optional coverage, and

- any myBenefits credits that are not used to pay for coverage under the Health Plans will be deposited into your Health Spending Account.
  [For coverage while on STD or LTD,](#bookmark30) see page 19.
  If you are on maternity or parental leave
  You will continue your coverage under the myBenefits program while on an approved maternity or parental leave. This coverage will continue for the period permitted under the Employment Insurance Act or any employment standards legislation.

- If you already have coverage for dependants and you want to add a new dependant for coverage under the Health Plans, you must do so within 60 days of their birth or adoption. Your new dependant can be added?
  using the myBenefits Enrolment System, available on myHR > Benefits & Life Changes > Benefits. If you do not have computer or Internet access, please call HR Advice Canada at 1-800-545-2555 to speak with an
  HR Advice Representative.

- If you did not already have dependant coverage and you want to elect coverage for your new child, you must do so within 60 days of their birth or adoption. You can elect coverage for your new child using the myBenefits [Enrolment System, available on myHR > Benefits & Life Changes > Benefits. If you do not have access to a computer, please call HR Advice Canada at 1-800-545-2555 to speak with a HR Advice Representative. Because this is considered an eligible change event, you will be allowed to review and change certain benefit options, although evidence of insurability (EOI) may be required, for details on EOI, refer to page](#bookmark18) 13.
  Premium deductions during a leave
  Under the myBenefits program, during a leave, regular premiums will be deducted from your payroll bank account corresponding to your payroll cycle (bi-weekly, semi-monthly, or monthly). Healthcare and insurance premiums are based on the coverage selected and the rates in effect. Funds for these deductions must be in your bank account in order for coverage to be effective. Should no funds be available in your bank account, optional coverage is at risk of being terminated.
  Survivor benefits
  The myBenefits program Health Plans (e.g., Paramedical and Vision, Emergency Out-of-Province/Country Medical and Travel Assistance, Drugs and Medical, and Dental) include survivor benefits.
  If at the time of your death you are participating in the myBenefits program Health Plans:

- your surviving spouse/partner, if already covered under these plans, will continue to be eligible for coverage without further payment of premiums under these plans until the end of the month following the first anniversary of your death.

- your surviving dependent children, if already covered under these plans, will continue to be eligible for coverage without further payment of premiums under these plans until the end of the month following the first anniversary of your death, or until such time as they no longer qualify as an eligible dependant, whichever is earlier.
  When coverage ends
  Under the myBenefits program, your coverage will end when your employment with the company ends, you retire or upon your death, whichever comes first. For more details, refer to each benefit section.
  When you retire
  The myBenefits program does not extend into retirement. When you retire, you may be eligible to participate in an Techcom retiree benefits program. It is important to note that there are coverage differences under the Retiree FlexBenefits program and in order to elect coverage under the Retiree FlexBenefits program, coverage must be in effect as an active employee. You will not be able to elect coverage that is not in place as an active employee immediately prior to retirement, with the exception of Healthcare. For information on retiree benefit programs, including eligibility, refer to myHR > Financial Programs > Retirement Programs > Retiree FlexBenefits.
  Amendment and termination
  Techcom and its subsidiaries reserve the unilateral right to change, amend or terminate the coverage or contracts and/or policy documents underlying the myBenefits coverage at any time, and may be required to do so because of changes to legislation. In addition, Techcom also reserves the right at any time to amend the terms and conditions of the various myBenefits coverages, as well as the amount charged to the individual.

  Any remaining myBenefits credits will be deposited into your Health Spending Account and you will not be able to direct any remaining credits to your personal Wellness Account or RRSP.
  In addition, no further benefit changes will be permitted for the balance of the plan year, unless you have an eligible change event (i.e., the birth of a child, marriage, etc.). If you have an eligible change event, you will have 60 days from the date of the event to submit a change.
  Note that your coverage selection will not change for any optional insurance. However, as coverage is based on your benefit earnings for Life insurance, this coverage will be affected if your benefit earnings change.

# Health Plans?

There are few things in this world more important than our physical and mental health. With that in mind, the
myBenefits program offers three important health-related plans:

- a Paramedical and Vision Plan,
- a Drugs and Medical Plan, and
- a Dental Plan.
  All three plans give you the flexibility to choose the level of coverage you want. More coverage or less… you decide.
  Provincial health plans
  Provincial health plans provide your first line of defence against medical expenses. These plans typically cover a range of medical items, services and supplies, including:
- doctors’ and surgeons’ fees;
- specialists’ fees when referred by a general practitioner;
- diagnostic procedures, including X-rays and lab tests;
- some prescription drugs, in provinces with pharmacare;
- prenatal and maternity care;
- standard ward hospital accommodation;
- out-patient treatment; and
- other services and supplies.
  For further information about the expenses covered under your provincial health plan, refer to myHR > Benefits & Life Changes > Benefits > Provincial Health Plans.
  Changes to provincial health plans, the introduction of new medical and dental services, or the development of new prescription drugs will not result in automatic adjustments to the myBenefits program. Techcom will continually monitor the myBenefits program to determine what, if any, adjustments are required.
  Eligibility for Health Plans expenses?
  Eligible health and dental expenses will only be covered to the extent that:
- they are medically necessary,
- reasonable and customary (as determined by the insurer based on industry standards), and
- recommended by a physician or dentist (as appropriate).
  Continuing coverage under the Health Plans while on STD or LTD
  Your coverage under the myBenefits Health Plans (e.g., Paramedical and Vision, Drugs and Medical, and Dental) can continue while you are receiving STD or LTD benefits for approved absences.
- While on STD or LTD, you must continue to pay your premiums for Optional coverage.
  You cannot increase the level of your benefits coverage while on STD or LTD. You can, however, decrease the level of your benefits. You can change the class of your family coverage under the Health Plans if you have an eligible change event that alters the make-up of your family (i.e., a marriage, divorce, the qualifying or disqualifying of a spouse/partner, or the birth/adoption of a child).
  Survivor coverage under the Health Plans
  If, at the time of your death, you are participating in the myBenefits program:
- your surviving spouse/partner, if already covered under a Health Plan, will continue to be covered under that plan until the end of the month following the first anniversary of your death; and
- your surviving dependent child(ren), if already covered under a Health Plan, will continue to be covered under that plan until the end of the month following the first anniversary of your death or such time as they no longer qualify as a dependant… whichever comes first.
  This coverage is provided at no cost to your surviving spouse/partner or dependent child(ren).
  If, at the time of your death, you are at least age 55 and eligible to participate in the Retiree FlexBenefits program:
- your surviving spouse/partner, will be eligible to participate in the Healthcare coverage under the Retiree FlexBenefits
  program effective on the date of your death; and
- your surviving dependent child(ren), will be eligible to participate in the Healthcare coverage under the Retiree FlexBenefits program until such time as they no longer qualify as a dependant.
  Your survivors will need to cover the cost of Retiree FlexBenefits premiums. For information on retiree benefit programs including eligibility:
- refer to myHR > Financial Programs > Retirement Programs > Retiree FlexBenefits.
  When coverage ends under the Health Plans
  Under the myBenefits program, coverage under the Health Plans will end when your employment with the company ends, you retire, or upon your death… whichever comes first.
  In the case of Emergency Out-of-Province/Country Medical and Travel Assistance, coverage will also end on the earlier of:
- the end of the 31st day of any out-of-province/country trip. If you are hospitalized during your trip resulting in a delay beyond 31 days, your coverage will automatically extend for the period of hospitalization and up to an additional five days after discharge;
- your return to your province of residence following a trip;
- the end of your active employment with the company;
- you no longer qualify for benefit coverage; or
- the termination of your coverage under a provincial healthcare plan.
  The myBenefits program does not extend into retirement. When you retire, you may be eligible to participate in a benefit program for retired employees. If so, the retiree benefits available to you will be based on the retiree benefit program in place as of your date of retirement.

# Paramedical and Vision Plan?

The myBenefits Paramedical and Vision Plan (Sun Life — Policy 025365) allows you to select the coverage that fits your personal and family circumstances.
Your options
Under the Paramedical and Vision Plan, you have three levels of coverage to choose from, as summarized in the table on the next page.
Eligible expenses
Following is a summary of the eligible expenses that will be covered under the Paramedical and Vision Plan, provided they are:

- reasonable and customary, and
- covered under the option you select.
  Reasonable and customary: the plan will reimburse the cost of eligible services or supplies (subject to the terms and limits of your coverage) up to the reasonable and customary rates in the province where you live.
  The plan will not pay for costs that exceed these reasonable and customary rates.
  Vision care
  Reimbursement up to the applicable maximums for:
- eyeglasses or contact lenses prescribed by an ophthalmologist or optometrist; or

You do not, however, need to be referred for treatment by a physician. Only those expenses not covered by the provincial health plan in your province of residence will be reimbursed.
  What’s not covered
  Regardless of the option you select, the myBenefits Paramedical and Vision Plan does not pay any benefit or accept liability for claims relating to:

# Emergency?

# Out-of-Province/ Country Medical

# \+ Travel Assistance

An important part of your Health Plans is Emergency Out-of-Province/Country Medical and Travel Assistance. This is a company-paid, Core benefit. This plan provides emergency medical coverage and travel assistance if you have a medical emergency during the first 31 days of a trip outside your province or territory of residence. If you elect dependent coverage, your eligible dependant(s) will also qualify for coverage.

A medical emergency is a sudden, unforeseen injury or an acute episode of disease which commences during the period of coverage and which results in a medical condition requiring immediate treatment from a licensed physician or immediate hospitalization.

A medical condition is accidental bodily injury or sickness (or a condition related to that accidental bodily injury or sickness), including disease, acute psychoses and complications of pregnancy occurring within the first 31 weeks of pregnancy.

Eligible expenses

The plan covers reasonable and customary expenses (see _Reasonable and customary_, page 83) in excess of the amount covered by your provincial health insurance plan or other sources of similar coverage, for:

- hospital room and board in a ward or semi-private room;
- hospital services and supplies;
- the services of a licensed doctor;
- diagnostic services;
- outpatient services;
- ground ambulance transportation to and from a hospital when medically necessary; and
- air ambulance transportation when medically necessary and pre-approved by Allianz Global Assistance.
  The plan will reimburse 100% of eligible expenses not covered under your provincial healthcare plan or other sources of similar coverage. In all cases, treatment must be the result of a medical emergency that occurs while you and/or your eligible dependant(s) are temporarily outside your province/territory of residence or Canada for vacation or business purposes, and within the first 31 days of your departure.
  For details on when Emergency Out-of-Province/Country Medical and Travel Assistance coverage ends, see
  When coverage ends under the Health Plans on page 19.
  Travel assistance?
  While you and your eligible dependants are travelling for vacation or business, you are provided with emergency medical assistance through a worldwide communications network that operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The network locates medical services and obtains insurer approval for covered services.
  If you, your spouse/partner or eligible dependants experience an unexpected medical emergency that requires immediate treatment while travelling, you must contact Allianz Global Assistance at:
- Canada and the U.S.:1-866-496-5254 (toll-free)
- Worldwide: 905-816-1202 (collect)

  - the covered person, or the covered person’s traveling companion (who must be covered under this plan), are relocated to receive medical attention; or
  - the covered person is delayed beyond his/her return date in order to receive emergency treatment for an emergency covered under this insurance.
    The benefit is up to $150 per day to a maximum of $1,500 Canadian per family. This benefit is subject to the pre-authorization of Allianz Global Assistance*.*
- Return transportation (via economy class) for insured children left unattended due to the death or hospitalization of a covered person. Where necessary, a qualified attendant will be provided.

For travel in excess of the first 31 days, you may purchase travel medical insurance at preferred rates from Techcom Insurance. See myHR > Benefits & Life Changes > Employee Discounts for more information.

# Drugs and Medical Plan?

The cost of prescription drugs and other necessary medical expenses can add up quickly. Your myBenefits program recognizes that fact. That’s why it includes company-paid Core coverage, but also gives you the opportunity to upgrade your coverage with one of several employee-paid options.

Your options

Under the myBenefits Drugs and Medical Plan (Sun Life — Policy 053264), you have a total of three levels of coverage to pick from.

Managed formulary drugs

Techcom's drug plan uses a managed formulary. A formulary is simply a list of eligible drugs covered by the plan.

The formulary is managed by our Pharmacy Benefits Manager (PBM) and includes an evolving list of drugs. Drugs are regularly reviewed by our PBM's clinical pharmacists and a committee comprised of members with pharmacy expertise. Drugs can be added and removed from the formulary based on their efficacy, safety, cost-effectiveness. Where applicable, the plan covers the lowest cost alternative (generic) available.

[You can use Sun Life's Drug Lookup Tool on](https://www.mysunlife.ca/) www.mysunlife.ca or contact the Sun Life Customer Care Centre at 1-800-305-5905 if you have any questions about coverage of a drug your doctor is prescribing.

Mandatory generic substitution

Generic drugs have the same active ingredients as their brand name counterparts, and they have the same treatment outcomes. In fact, pharmacies are required to dispense the lowest cost alternative unless instructed by the patient or doctor otherwise.

The Drugs and Medical Plan covers prescription drugs up to the lowest cost generic equivalent. This means that if a generic drug is available and you choose to buy the brand name instead, you will be reimbursed up to the eligible cost of the generic drug, even if your doctor specifies “no substitution” on the prescription.

?

Mandatory biosimilar program

In keeping with the provincially funded public drug plans across Canada, the mandatory biosimilar program is embedded in the Techcom managed drug formulary for certain health conditions. This means that if you or your dependent is currently taking or is prescribed a biologic drug that has a comparable biosimilar drug, only the biosimilar drug will be covered\*. Health Canada defines a biosimilar as a biologic drug that is highly similar to a biologic drug that was already authorized for sale. There are no expected clinically meaningful differences in efficacy and safety between a biosimilar and the originator or reference biologic.

Here’s how biosimilars work as part of the myBenefits program (effective July 1, 2023):

- The Techcom plan requires the use of biosimilars in the same way your province of residence does.
- If you or one of your dependents takes a biologic drug that the Techcom plan excludes:
  - Sun Life will contact you by letter if you, or one of your dependents made a claim for the originator biologic
  - You (or your dependent) have six months from the date of Sun Life’s communication to transition to the biosimilar. At that point, payment for the cost of the originator biologic will end.

If your treatment starts after July 1, 2023, only the biosimilar is covered by the plan. This also applies if you’ve just joined the Techcom plan and already take an originator biologic\*.

If you don’t transition to the biosimilar drug, you will not be reimbursed for the cost of the biologic\*. This means you may be out of pocket for 100% of your drug costs unless you have other coverage.

Please check in with your health care provider before making a decision

Your health-care provider will:

- Tell you more about the biosimilar option,
- Help you decide whether transitioning to the biosimilar option would be clinically effective and safe for you, and
- Provide you with a new prescription when you transition.

You can choose to stay on a biologic drug, but you may have high out-of-pocket costs. If you wish to continue your biologic treatment, your health-care provider may be able to help you find other sources of funding – this may include manufacturer patient support programs. You may want to consider contacting CarePath (1-888-755-2088) as they can provide no-cost navigation support to you and your dependants which includes facilitating access to tests, treatments, and clinical trials.

\*Medical exceptions

1. Eligible expenses are limited to what’s considered Reasonable and Customary (R&C) as defined by Sun Life and/or the plan. For example, if you purchase a medical service for $300 but the R&C limit is $250, only the $250 will be considered for reimbursement or count towards the deductible under the plan. The $50, plus any other amounts over the R&C limits, are your responsibility.
2. Where applicable, drugs, vaccines, services and equipment available through a provincial plan are the first payer.
3. Up to 180 day maximum per disability.

If you live in Quebec

Provincial law requires that you be reimbursed at a minimum rate of your eligible drug expenses. The rate (which is periodically adjusted by RAMQ) was 65% as of July 1, 2022. Once you or your spouse/partner reach an out-of-pocket maximum of $1,161 set by RAMQ , the plan will pay 100% of your additional eligible expenses for the balance of the plan year. This means you must choose coverage for your spouse/partner and children unless you have the minimum required coverage (based on the reimbursement rate specified by RAMQ) under another plan. Drugs that are covered by RAMQ but not listed on the formulary will be reimbursed at the rate set by RAMQ. The plan year for drugs paid by RAMQ is January 1 to December 31. When you enrol, you will be asked to confirm whether you have the minimum required RAMQ drug coverage for you and/or your eligible dependants.

Dispensing fee cap?

A dispensing fee is charged by pharmacists for the cost of evaluating, preparing and packaging a prescription drug. Dispensing fees can vary widely from pharmacy to pharmacy – from $4 to $12 or more.

The plan will reimburse each dispensing fee expense up to the $10 cap, at the rate for your level of coverage (e.g., for Comprehensive coverage, the plan pays 80% of a $10 dispensing fee). You pay the full cost for any portion of the dispensing fee above $10.

In Quebec, for each service, supply or drug, the invoice issued by the pharmacist must clearly show:

- the pharmacist’s professional fee
- the amount covered by the basic prescription drug insurance plan
- the wholesaler’s profit margin, if applicable.

If a Quebec pharmacist does not post their dispensing fees and/or their receipts do not split drug cost and professional fees, Sun Life deems the dispensing fee to be the difference between the full amount that the pharmacist charged, and the maximum ingredient cost per pill multiplied by the number of pills dispensed.

Pay-direct drug card

Under the myBenefits program, a digital pay-direct drug (PDD) card is provided for drug coverage. A PDD card enables the pharmacist to tell you on-the-spot if your drug is covered on the formulary before you purchase your prescription. If your drug is eligible, the pharmacist will bill the plan directly for all eligible expenses. You pay only the portion of your prescription that isn’t covered.

[Visit the Sun Life website at](http://www.mysunlife.ca/) www.mysunlife.ca to request PDD cards for dependants. To add your PDD card to your digital wallet:

- Sign into the my Sun Life mobile app using your access ID and password.
- Select _Benefits_ from the main menu.
- Select _Coverage_ card, then _drug card_.
  Keep in mind that not all drug expenses can be processed with your PDD card. Refer to the list of eligible expenses below.
  Eligible expenses
  The Drugs and Medical Plan covers certain drugs prescribed by a physician, dentist or, where applicable under provincial law, other qualified health professionals. Prescription drugs are reimbursed according to the reasonable and customary rates in the province where you live.
  To be eligible for coverage, drugs must:
- be listed on the formulary;
- be assigned a Canadian drug identification number (DIN); and
- legally require a prescription.
  [To determine if a drug is covered under the formulary, use the Drug Look-up Tool available at](http://www.mysunlife.ca/) www.mysunlife.ca to search by drug name or drug identification number (DIN).
  For brand name prescription drugs that have a generic version, myBenefits is a mandatory generic substitution plan and only covers the cost up to the amount charged for a generic equivalent, even if your doctor specifies on the actual script – in his or her own handwriting – that there can be no substitutes.
  The following items are covered under the Drugs and Medical Plan, to specific limits, and are available using your PDD card:
- contraceptives including birth control pills, diaphragms, intrauterine devices (IUDs), transdermal patches;

  In addition, the cost for the treatment of rehabilitation of alcohol or drug abuse in a licensed substance abuse rehabilitation centre, provided the provincial health care plan pays the equivalent of ward level accommodation. The maximum amount payable is the difference between the cost of a ward and a private or semi-private room up to a lifetime maximum of $20,000 per covered person. Prior approval by the plan administrator, Sun Life, is recommended.
  Reimbursement for treatment in a private facility is not an eligible expense.

- artificial limbs and eyes, including myoelectric appliances, C-legs and any technologically-advanced prosthetic devices when a standard prosthesis will not suffice.
  Wheelchairs
  The plan will cover charges for manual wheelchairs (up to $10,000/5 years) except if the person’s medical condition warrants the use of electric wheelchair (up to $30,000/5 years).

Coverage is subject to $3,000 annual deductible reset at the beginning of the plan year on July 1.
  Keep in mind that the plan will reimburse only:

  To obtain a list of impacted Prior Authorization drugs, as well as the application form, simply visit
  www.mysunlife.ca or the my Sun Life app to log in and find a link to Prior Authorization drugs.
  Sun Life and its pharmacy benefit management provider regularly review the Prior Authorization drug list to see if new drugs should be added or if some drugs should be removed. Based on these reviews, the drugs in the Prior Authorization program may change from time to time.
  If you are prescribed one of the drugs on the list, you and your doctor must complete and submit a Prior Authorization form – details related to eligibility are included on the form. All requests are processed within five business days when your form is completed in full and received by Sun Life. Sun Life will notify you of their decision in writing.
  If your request is approved, your drug will be paid for under your plan option as usual.
  If your request is denied, the drug will not be paid for under the plan. However, you can choose to pay for the drug yourself, through your Health Spending Account (HSA), or through a spouse’s benefit plan if such coverage is available.
  You may also ask your doctor about other drug treatment options.
  If you submit a claim without prior approval, it will be declined and you will be advised to complete and submit the Prior Authorization form.
  For Quebec residents, drugs included in both the RAMQ formulary and the myBenefits Prior Authorization program will be reimbursed at the RAMQ minimum with no pre-approval required. To claim the difference between the RAMQ minimum and your myBenefits coverage, you must submit the required form for approval.
  Note, some doctors will charge a fee to complete your form. You are responsible for paying your doctor directly, but you can submit your doctor’s fees to your HSA for reimbursement.
  For more information about the Prior Authorization program, you can speak with a representative at the Sun Life Customer Care Centre at 1-800-305-5905.
  Integration with provincial drug programs
  Some provinces have special disease-specific programs that cover drugs beyond the basic provincial drug program. The plan will integrate with benefits payable or available under the government-sponsored plan or program.
  The covered expense under the Drugs and Medical plan is that portion of the expense that is not payable or available under the government program, regardless of:
- whether you have made an application to the government program;

# Gender Affirmation Services

Your myBenefits Gender Affirmation Services coverage is designed to assist you and your eligible dependants to live as authentically as you choose to. This coverage, available through your Drugs and Medical Plan (Sun Life — Policy 053264), helps to supplement the coverage for surgeries with additional financial support.
Although most provincial or territorial health care plans pay for surgery for those who meet the plan’s requirements, coverage levels are not all the same. As well, many public health care plans don’t cover surgeries that feminize or mascu-linize an individual’s features. Your Gender Affirmation Services coverage through myBenefits helps to fill in these gaps.
Your options
Your myBenefits Gender Affirmation Services plan covers certain basic surgical procedures not available under your provincial or territorial health care plan. Examples include tracheal (Adam's apple) shaving and voice surgery.
Additionally your plan covers for surgical procedures to align feminine or masculine features to the transitioned gender, such as facial bone reduction, cheek augmentation or adding pectoral implants.
Your Gender Affirmation Services plan coverage provides a lifetime maximum up to $50,000 depending on your level of coverage for Drugs and Medical.
Eligible expenses

- treatment of periodontal and other diseases of the gums or tissues of the mouth;

- endodontic treatment, including root canal therapy; and

- test and lab exams for endodontic and periodontic services.
  Major restorative services
  Reimbursement (up to the rate specified for each level) for the following services:

- the first installation, including adjustments, of a partial or full denture;

- replacement of a denture that is at least five years old and no longer serviceable;

- addition of teeth to an existing partial denture;

  Services or supplies for implantology are not covered. However, for an implant-related crown or prosthesis, the plan will pay the benefit that would have been payable under this plan for a tooth-supported crown or for a non-implant related prosthesis, respectively. The plan will take into account any limitations that would have applied if there had been no implant. All other expenses related to implants, including surgery charges, are not covered.
  Orthodontia (Coordination and Comprehensive only)
  Reimbursement (up to the rate specified for each level) for the following basic services:

- orthodontic treatment; and

- orthodontic appliances (e.g., appliances to straighten permanent teeth, regain lost space, maintain space, correct cross-bites and/or control oral habits).
  Both children and adults are eligible.

  Treatment plan?
  If treatment under the Dental Plan is expected to cost more than $500, you should ask your dentist to submit a treatment plan to the insurance company before treatment begins. A treatment plan is simply a description of the proposed procedure and its related cost.
  The insurance company will review the plan and report what portion of the cost (if any) is covered under the Dental Plan. This will allow you to determine how much reimbursement you can expect – before your treatment begins and provided you and/or your eligible dependants remain eligible when the treatment occurs.
  In the case of orthodontic work, reimbursement will be based on an established payment schedule. Eligible expenses will be reimbursed as work is actually completed.
  What’s not covered

- Supplies usually related to sports (e.g., mouthguards).

- Expenses covered under another myBenefits program (e.g., Paramedical and Vision) or any other policy (e.g., under another group plan).

- Charges that exceed the usual and customary rates for the least expensive alternative service or material that is consistent with normal dental care.

- Services or supplies that are considered by the insurer to be unreasonable under the terms of the contract.

- Expenses you would not normally incur in the absence of this coverage.

- Dental services provided primarily for improving appearance.

- Services or supplies for implantology.

- Charges related to temporomandibular joint (TMJ) treatment.

- Charges for a missed appointment, counselling or completion of a claim form.

- Experimental treatment.

- Expenses for lost or stolen dental appliance, (e.g., dentures).

- Expenses arising from:

  - committing or attempting to commit an unlawful act;
  - insurrection or war (declared or not);
  - participation in any riot, civil commotion or any other act of aggression; or
  - injury or illness arising out of any occupation or paid employment other than for Techcom.

    # Health Spending Account?

    The Health Plans (e.g., Drugs and Medical, Paramedical and Vision, and Dental) available under the myBenefits program are comprehensive. But they don’t always cover everything. That’s where the Health Spending Account (HSA) (Sun Life — Policy 025365 ) comes in. It lets you use myBenefits credits to pay for a host of expenses not covered by the options you select under the various Health Plans.
    How it works
    When you first enrol in the myBenefits program, and at each annual enrolment period that follows, you’ll receive an allotment of credits. (If you are hired part way through the plan year, you’ll receive a prorated allotment of credits.) These credits are used to help cover the cost of your benefit selections under the various Health Plans
    (e.g., Drugs and Medical, Paramedical and Vision, and Dental). Excess credits can be used to help pay for any Optional Life and Accidental Death & Dismemberment insurance you elect. (They cannot be used to pay for Critical Illness insurance.) You can also choose to direct some or all of your excess credits to your Health Spending Account (HSA).
    The money in your HSA can be used to pay for any eligible medical, drug or dental expenses that are not covered (or not fully covered) by your benefit selections. The more money that flows to your HSA, the more
    money you’ll have available to cover these expenses.
    See Wellness Account [on](#bookmark71) page 40 and Registered Retirement Savings Plan [on](#bookmark75) page 42 for the two other options you have for allocating excess myBenefits credits.
    Eligible expenses
    [Your HSA covers all eligible expenses as defined in the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) tax rules – but only to the extent that those expenses are not covered under a provincial or private healthcare plan. You can use your HSA to cover a portion of expenses not covered by a health or dental benefits plan such as deductibles, coinsurances or amounts over plan maximums. For a list of covered expenses refer to the Sun Life website at](http://www.mysunlife.ca/) www.mysunlife.ca. Go to Benefits Centre, then select Health Spending Account.
    To qualify as an eligible expense, the service, procedure or item must be provided or prescribed by a medical practitioner who is licensed in the province in which he or she is practicing.
    Your expense claims should first be submitted to the myBenefits plan for payment (unless you have chosen the Core option), or any other benefit plan you are covered under, before you submit them to your HSA. Your HSA will cover only those expenses that aren’t covered, or aren’t fully covered, by any other plan you may be eligible for.
    The taxing truth
    The HSA can help you reduce your tax hit. This is because you do not pay income tax on the claims paid from credits you transfer to your HSA account unless you are a Quebec resident. And that makes a huge difference in how much money you have available to spend on medical, prescription drug and dental-related expenses.

    Here are some numbers to consider. At a 35% marginal tax rate, you need to earn $385 in taxable income in order to have enough dollars to cover the cost of a $250 medical expense – the other $135 (the difference between $385 and $250) goes directly to the tax collector before you even see it. However, if you transfer $385 in credits to your HSA, you could pay the $250 expense and still have $135 left in your HSA to spend on other expenses.?
    In other words, if you use the HSA, you win in two ways:

- First, you get to use money in the form of credits; it’s not money you pay out of your own pocket.
- Second, you get to spend this money on a pre-tax basis, which can dramatically increase your purchasing power.
  Carrying credits forward
  For the HSA to qualify as a tax-preferred program, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) requires your HSA to have an element of risk. This risk is what we call the use-it-or-lose-it factor.
  Based on current CRA provisions, if you have credits remaining in your account at the end of the plan year (i.e., at June 30), you can carry forward your remaining credits for one additional plan year to cover any expenses incurred and submitted before the end of this additional plan year. If you do not use these remaining credits before the end of this following plan year (i.e., the following June 30), they will be forfeited.
  For example, credits provided for the plan year July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023 not used as of June 30, 2023 will be carried forward to the next plan year, i.e., July 1, 2023 to June 30, 2024. Any remaining credits as of June 30, 2024 (from those allocated during the plan year July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023) will be forfeited.
  Defining dependants
  You can make claims under your HSA for you and your dependants. When it comes to your HSA, dependants can include your spouse/partner and child(ren), as well as anyone who is recognized as your dependant by the Canada Revenue Agency and who otherwise isn’t covered under your myBenefits Health Plans (e.g., Paramedical and Vision, Drugs and Medical, and Dental).
  A person can qualify as your dependant if he or she:
- is the child, grandchild, parent, grandparent, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, niece or nephew of you or your spouse/part-ner;
- is dependent on you for support; and
- has been a resident of Canada during the year. (This residency requirement does not apply if the person is the child or grandchild of you or your spouse/partner.)

Keep in mind that you can submit claims to your HSA for your spouse/partner and eligible dependants – even if you’ve selected _Employee Only_ coverage under the myBenefits Health Plans.

Quebec residents

If you live in Quebec, any medical, prescription drug and dental expenses (including related retail sales tax and administration fees) paid with credits from your HSA will be considered a taxable benefit. You’ll escape the federal tax hit, but provincial income tax will apply.

When you leave

If your employment with Techcom ends, you will no longer have access to funds in your HSA. Claims for expenses incurred before your employment ended must be submitted within 90 days following your termination or retirement date to be eligible for reimbursement.

See page 75 for specific details on claim submission.

# Wellness Account?

Techcom is committed to helping you make healthy lifestyle choices and wants to support you with your personal wellness goals. The Wellness credits you earn will be deposited into a Wellness Account (Sun Life — Policy 150284), from which you can make claims for personal wellness-related expenses. The Wellness Account is a personal spending account that is funded by Techcom.

How it works

You can earn up to $300 in Wellness credits each year by participating in certain wellness initiatives. These credits are deposited into your Wellness Account.

If you have any excess credits not used to pay for your myBenefits coverage, you can choose to direct some or all of these excess credits to your Wellness Account.

The credits in your Wellness Account can be used for products and services that support your nutrition, physical activity, and mental health. Eligible expenses include gym memberships, fitness equipment, footwear required for fitness activities, weight management programs, smoking cessation programs, vitamins and supplements and more. For a list of all eligible expenses, review the Wellness Account Claim Form which contains the full list of the expenses covered by your Wellness Account, along with any special criteria for eligibility. The claim form is available at myHR >Benefits & Life Changes > Benefits > Forms & Contacts.

Please note that expenses that are covered by government healthcare or your myBenefits program are not eligible under your Wellness Account.

Your Wellness Account covers only those claims incurred by you, the employee. Credits cannot be applied to expenses for family members.

More details are available at myHR > Well-Being > Wellness.

See Health Spending Account [on](#bookmark67) page 38 and Registered Retirement Savings Plan [on](#bookmark75) page 42 for the two other options you have for allocating excess myBenefits credits.

Taxable benefit

The Wellness Account is considered a taxable benefit to you. Techcom is responsible for deducting all payroll-related taxes and deductions, as well as tax reporting to you. You will see the taxable benefit reported on your payroll statement shortly after your expense is reimbursed.

Use it or lose it?

Your wellness credits must be used within 12 months of the plan year end date (June 30) of the year you incurred the expense.

Your Wellness Account gives you the option to carry forward unused credits, for a period of 12 months from the plan year end date (June 30) of the benefit year in which you earned the credits. However, any credits carried forward and unused at the end of the second plan year are lost.

By carrying forward balances, you enjoy a longer time period in which to use your credits – which helps you

get the most value possible from your Wellness Account. As well, you can accumulate credits before you incur a larger expense.

Here’s an example of how credits and claiming work under your Wellness Account:

Employees on leave

Employees on leave may participate in Wellness Campaigns to earn Wellness credits. Refer to myHR @ Home or with your manager for details on how to participate during your leave.

Note: the following employees are excluded:

- Techcom employees who commenced Long Term Disability prior to July 1, 2012.
- Techcom Investor & Treasury Services employees who commenced Long Term Disability prior to July 1, 2013.

When you leave

When your employment with Techcom ends, you will no longer have access to funds in your Wellness Account. Claims for expenses incurred before your employment ended must be submitted within 90 days of your termination or retirement date to be eligible for reimbursement.

See page 75 for specific details on claim submission.

# Registered Retirement Savings Plan?

If you have excess myBenefits credits and you hold a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) in the Royal Employee Savings and Share Ownership Plan/Dominion Securities Savings Plan (RESSOP/DSSP), you have the option of directing your excess Basic credits to your RRSP account through RESSOP/DSSP.

How it works

Each excess myBenefits credit that is directed to an RRSP will represent a $1 contribution to RESSOP/DSSP. Since these contributions are paid by Techcom, they will not be eligible for Techcom matching contributions to RESSOP/DSSP.

Your excess myBenefits credits vest immediately (i.e., if you leave Techcom before completing two years of plan membership, you will still be entitled to these funds, plus investment earnings and losses). Once credited to your RRSP, your excess myBenefits credits will be invested according to the same investment directions that you made – or may change from time to time – for your RRSP account.

In addition, once excess myBenefits credits are credited to your RRSP account, they cannot be converted back to myBenefits credits in the future. For each plan year, the RRSP contribution through myBenefits credits will be limited to the amount of the Basic credit.

Enrolling in RESSOP/DSSP

In order to choose the RRSP option for your excess myBenefits credits, you must hold an RRSP account within RESSOP/ DSSP.

[If you are not enrolled in RESSOP/DSSP, you may enrol (or pre-enrol prior for the date you become eligible to join) online at](http://www.mysunlife.ca/) www.mysunlife.ca [through the MAX Express tool. Eligibility requirements for RESSOP/DSSP are outlined in the](http:// techcom.com/assets/me-and-rbc/documents/ressop-and-dssp-eng.pdf) Techcom Savings Program (RESSOP/DSSP) Booklet.

[If you are already enrolled in RESSOP/DSSP and have not opened an RRSP account, you may do so online at](http://www.mysunlife.ca/) [www.](http://www.mysunlife.ca/) [](http://www.mysunlife.ca/) mysunlife.ca through the MAX Express tool.

If you do not open an RRSP account in RESSOP/DSSP at the time of enrolment and you have chosen the RRSP option for your excess myBenefits credits, your excess credits will remain in the myBenefits program and will be directed to your Health Spending Account (HSA).

Tax treatment

The excess myBenefits credits that you direct to your RRSP are taxable to you and will be included, for income tax purposes, as part of your income. By contributing the excess myBenefits credits to your RRSP, you are confirming that you have sufficient RRSP contribution room. Therefore, tax will not be withheld on this amount. However, other source deductions (such as CPP/QPP and EI) may apply. You will receive an RRSP contribution receipt from

Sun Life.

It is your responsibility to ensure you have sufficient RRSP contribution room. You can find your RRSP contribution room by visiting My Account for Individuals [at](http://www.canada.ca/) www.canada.ca.

# Life insurance?

Life insurance is an important source of financial protection for your family. Recognizing the immediate cash-flow needs that will arise if you die, Techcom provides some Basic Employee Life coverage as part of your Core coverage.

Depending on your personal financial commitments, this may be the only coverage you need. However, the myBenefits program allows you to buy additional coverage. You may also be able to buy coverage for your spouse/ partner and dependent child(ren).

Basic Employee Life

As part of your Core coverage, the company provides you with Basic Employee Life insurance (Techcom Insurance — Policy 800079) equal to 1 times your benefit earnings, to a maximum of $300,000. (For an explanation of benefit earnings, refer to the Glossary of Terms.) This Basic coverage is paid for by the company (and is, therefore, considered a taxable benefit).

However, no evidence of insurability (EOI) is required, for details on EOI, please refer to _Eligibility and important information_ [on page 10.](#bookmark12)

Optional Employee Life

Options Available

Amount of Coverage\*

[\* Evidence of insurability may be required – see page](#bookmark79) [41 for details. Coverage may be affected by a pre-existing medical condition – see page](#bookmark81) [42 for details. For an explanation of benefit earnings, see page](#bookmark139) 75\. The maximum optional coverage from age 70 is 1 times benefit earnings.

If you need more than the Basic Employee Life insurance, you can apply for additional insurance under the Optional Employee Life Insurance (Policy 800081) Plan. There are eight options for you to choose from:

|          |                          |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| Option 1 | No coverage              |
| Option 2 | 1 times benefit earnings |
| Option 3 | 2 times benefit earnings |
| Option 4 | 3 times benefit earnings |
| Option 5 | 4 times benefit earnings |
| Option 6 | 5 times benefit earnings |
| Option 7 | 6 times benefit earnings |
| Option 8 | 7 times benefit earnings |

The maximum Employee Life insurance you can have – including Basic and Optional – is $3,750,000.

How much you pay for your Optional Employee Life insurance will vary depending on your age, gender, smoker status and the amount of coverage you select.

Optional Spousal Life?

As a member of the myBenefits program, you can also select Life insurance coverage for your eligible spouse/partner. You have a number of options to consider:

You can choose up to 12 units of $25,000 each (to a maximum of $300,000) or no coverage.

[\* Evidence of insurability may be required – see below. Coverage may be affected by a pre-existing medical condition –](#bookmark81) see page 42 for details. The maximum coverage from age 70 is $50,000.

Like Optional Employee Life insurance, the cost of Optional Spousal Life (Techcom Insurance — Policy 800081) will vary depending on your spouse’s/partner’s age, gender and smoker status.

Optional Dependent Child(ren) Life

Optional dependent Child(ren) Life Policy 800081

You can also elect to insure the lives of your dependent child(ren):

|                   |                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------ |
| Options Available | Amount of Coverage |
| Option 1          | No coverage        |
| Option 2          | $5,000             |
| Option 3          | $10,000            |
|                   |                    |

Your selected coverage will be provided at a single flat rate, regardless of the number of eligible dependent children you have. No evidence of insurability (EOI) is required for Optional Dependent Child(ren) Life (Techcom Insurance — Policy 800081).

Evidence of insurability

When you first enrol, you do not need to provide evidence of insurability (EOI) for:

- Basic Employee Life insurance,

- Optional Employee Life insurance up to 2 times benefit earnings,

- Optional Spousal Life insurance up to $25,000, or

- any Dependent Child(ren) Life insurance.
  When you enrol during the annual enrolment period, EOI will be required for any:

- increase in Optional Employee Life insurance, and

- increase in Optional Spousal Life insurance.
  If you change your coverage following an eligible change event, EOI will be required for any:

- new Optional Employee Life insurance over 2 times benefit earnings, and

- new Optional Spousal Life insurance above the first $25,000.
  Smoker/non-smoker rates
  Smokers pay more for their coverage than non-smokers. This reflects the fact that medical research indicates that, on average, non-smokers live longer than smokers.
  Under the terms of the myBenefits program, a non-smoker is anyone who has not used tobacco-related products (including e-cigarettes, vaping products, patches, nicotine chewing gum, etc.) for a full 12 months. A non-smoker cannot use tobacco-related products during the plan year or coverage will be voided automatically.
  If you (or your spouse/partner) indicate that you are a non-smoker and then start using tobacco-related products, you must update your smoker/non-smoker status immediately and switch to smoker rates – otherwise your Optional Life insurance coverage will be voided automatically. You can change your smoker/non-smoker status, using the myBenefits Enrolment System, which can be accessed from myHR > Benefits & Life Changes > Benefits.
  Effective date
  Any coverage for which evidence of insurability (EOI) is required will not go into effect until the date the EOI is approved by the insurance carrier. Once approval is received, your insurance premiums will be adjusted to reflect the new coverage amount.
  If your spouse/partner or dependent child is in hospital on the date Optional Spousal or dependent Child(ren) Life insurance coverage is due to begin, that coverage will not go into effect until the date following the last day of hospitalization. This requirement does not apply to a newborn child.

  Pre-existing conditions?
  If, within two years of starting or increasing optional coverage for which no evidence of insurability is required, you (or your spouse/partner) die from a pre-existing medical condition, the benefit payable will be limited to:

- the insurance coverage that has been in place for more than two years, and

- the premiums paid (without interest) for insurance that has been in place less than two years.
  Living death benefit
  If you are diagnosed with a terminal illness and have a life expectancy of 12 months or less, you may receive an advance benefit. This benefit, payable while you are still alive, will equal 50% of your Employee Life insurance (Basic and Optional combined), to a maximum of $100,000.
  Similarly, if you elect Optional Spousal Life insurance and your spouse/partner is diagnosed as terminally ill with a life expectancy of 12 months or less, you may receive an advance benefit. The living benefit payable will equal 50% of the insured amount, to a maximum of $100,000.
  The overall life benefit available will be reduced by the amount of any advance benefit received.
  What’s not covered
  If an insured person takes their own life within two years of starting or increasing their coverage, the benefit payable will be limited to:

- the insurance coverage that has been in place for more than two years, and

- the premiums paid (without interest) for insurance that has been in place less than two years.
  Continuing coverage
  You can continue your Life insurance coverage while receiving STD or LTD benefits.
  In the case of Basic Employee Life insurance, coverage will continue at no cost to you. In the case of Optional Employee Life, Optional Spousal Life and Optional dependent Child(ren) Life insurance, you must continue to pay your premiums while you are on STD or LTD. You cannot increase your coverage amounts while on STD or LTD.
  When coverage ends
  Under the myBenefits program, your Employee Life insurance (Basic and Optional) coverage will end when your employment with the company ends, you retire, or upon your death… whichever comes first.
  Optional Spousal Life and dependent Child(ren) Life insurance will end when your coverage ends, when your spouse/partner and eligible child(ren) no longer qualify, or when your spouse/partner and eligible child(ren) die… whichever comes first.
  Converting your coverage
  When your employment with the company ends, you will – if you are under age 65 – have the opportunity
  to convert your Basic and Optional Employee Life insurance (to a maximum of $200,000) to an individual policy. The availability of this option will depend on the terms of the policy and applicable legislation. You must also be residing in Canada, e.g., this option is not available to Canadian-dollar expatriates. The option to convert Life insurance is not available to employees who are age 65 or older, or employees eligible for an immediate pension from the Techcom Retirement program when they leave Techcom\*.
  However, if eligible, you may be able to extend your coverage under the Retiree FlexBenefits program.
  You can convert your Basic and Optional Employee Life coverage without providing evidence of insurability, provided you apply for coverage and pay the required premium within 31 days of your termination date. If you die during the 31-day conversion period, your beneficiary (or estate) will receive the full value of your coverage, even if you have not applied for a conversion of coverage.
  You may convert your Optional Spousal Life insurance to an individual policy (to a maximum of $200,000) at the same time. Again, your spouse/partner will not have to provide evidence of insurability (EOI) if the application is submitted and the first premium payment is made before the end of the 31-day conversion period.
  If your spouse/partner dies during the conversion period, you will automatically receive the benefit selected under the Optional Spousal Life Plan, even if an application for a conversion of coverage has not been made.
  You may also convert your Child(ren) Optional Life insurance at the same time to a maximum of $10,000 without medical evidence.
  For more information, please contact HR Advice Canada at 1-800-545-2555 to speak with an HR Advice Representative. \* \_Exception: in accordance with current legislation, Quebec employees may convert Basic/Optional Life insurance up to age 65, even if retiring.

  # Short Term Disability?

  The Short Term Disability Plan (STD) (Manulife) provides you with a continuing source of income for approved disabilities lasting up to 17 weeks. It is designed to protect your income if you are unable to work for a short period of time due to injury or illness and qualify for this leave. Techcom provides this plan at no cost to you as part of your Core coverage.
  Eligibility and coverage
  In order to qualify for STD benefits, you must meet all of the criteria below. For clarity, in order to receive STD benefits, you:

- must have completed three months of active\* continuous service with Techcom since qualifying for other benefits;

- cannot fully complete the essential duties of your job due to illness or injury;

- are under the regular care of a qualified physician;

- are receiving and complying with appropriate medical treatment; and

- provide medical evidence (including an independent assessment, if required) when requested by the administrator or case manager to confirm that your disability prevents you from working.
  You need to apply for STD benefits during the first seven calendar days of your absence. If approved, your STD effective date will generally be the day after your last day worked.
  Manulife will review your claim based on medical information provided by your physician. In addition, Manulife works in conjunction with the Canadian Medical Association policy as well as standard medical recovery guidelines. Manulife’s decision will be rendered on this basis.
  In most cases, the amount of your STD benefit will depend on your benefit base and length of service with Techcom, as outlined in the following chart. There may, however, be some differences for those employees receiving commissions, depending on the compensation arrangements that have been communicated to them.

- your Core coverage will continue at no cost to you,

- you will continue to receive your myBenefits credits, and

- you must continue to pay your premiums for any Optional coverage (Healthcare, Optional Life, AD&D and Critical Illness).
  You cannot increase any of your benefit coverages under the myBenefits program while on STD. There are exceptions to this rule. If you have an eligible change event that affects the make-up of your family (e.g., a marriage, divorce, birth, etc.), you can adjust your “class” of family coverage within 60 days of the event taking place.
  Under the myBenefits program regular premiums will be deducted from your payroll bank account corresponding to your payroll cycle (bi-weekly, semi-monthly or monthly). Healthcare and insurance premiums are based on the coverage selected and the rates in effect. Funds for these deductions must be in your bank account in order for coverage to be effective. Should no funds be available in your bank account, coverage is at risk of being terminated.
  Medical evidence
  While on STD, you may be asked periodically by the administrator or case manager to provide medical evidence to support that your disability prevents you from working. The information must be considered satisfactory to the administrator/case manager in order for your benefit payments to continue. If you need to provide medical evidence, you should ask your doctor(s) to supply detailed medical evidence documenting how your illness or injury prevents you from working as quickly as possible, so that benefit payments are not interrupted. If your doctor charges for this service, you will be responsible for paying the related fees.
  Note: Medical evidence may include but is not limited to details of your treatment plan, copies of relevant test results/investigative reports, copies of clinical notes, consult reports from specialists, a summary of observable physical findings, prognosis for recovery, and/or measurable clinical signs confirmed by a recognized physician with expertise in the area of the relevant medical condition(s) that are preventing you from working.
  You may also be asked to attend a medical examination conducted by a medical professional scheduled by the administrator/case manager. Failure to undergo a medical and/or psychological examination requested by the administrator/case manager may result in the termination of benefit payments and you may be required to pay the missed appointment charge.
  Successive and recurring disabilities
  If you have a relapse from the same or related illness or injury within four weeks of returning to work, your STD benefits will resume. However, your previous STD period will be taken into account when determining how long you can collect benefits.
  If you return to work and then go off work again due to an unrelated illness or injury, you will begin a new period of STD benefits. Eligibility does not extend during periods of an unauthorized leave.
  If you do not qualify for STD benefits
  If RBC’s administrator (Manulife) determines that you do not qualify for STD benefits, you are expected to return to work. Until you return to work, your absence may:

- be considered unauthorized by Techcom;

- result in the discontinuance of any further income payment;

- have an effect on your eligibility for other benefits, including disability benefits in respect of any new illness or injury; and

- have an effect on you or your dependants’ eligibility for accidental death & dismemberment benefits or critical illness.

  Premium deductions during a leave?
  Under the myBenefits program, during your leave regular premiums will be deducted from your payroll bank account corresponding to your payroll cycle (bi-weekly, semi-monthly, or monthly). Healthcare and insurance premiums are based on the coverage selected and the rates in effect. Funds for these deductions must be in your bank account in order for coverage to be effective. Should no funds be available in your bank account, coverage is at risk of being terminated.
  When STD benefits are not paid
  STD benefits will not be paid for:

- any day you work for pay or profit;

- any period for which you have not provided the necessary medical information supporting your disability;

- any claims that relate to illnesses or injuries that arose prior to you completing three (3) months of active continuous service with Techcom since qualifying for benefits;

- a disability for which benefits are payable under a provincially sponsored workers’ compensation program;

- a disability that results from self-inflicted injury, war, insurrection, riot or civil commotion;

- a disability that results from the commission of (or intent to commit) a criminal act;

- a disability during maternity or parental leave;

- any period during a leave of absence, strike or layoff (following the statutory notice period);

- a disability that is the result of drug or alcohol abuse, unless confined in hospital or participating in a rehabilitation program that has been approved by the administrator/insurer; or

- a disability that is the result of medical or surgical care which is not medically necessary, such as cosmetic surgery, is not covered.

  # Long Term Disability?

  Long Term Disability (Manulife — Techcom Policy 39150/ Techcom I&TS Policy 38025) provides a continuing source of income during approved disabilities that extend beyond 17 weeks of approved Short Term Disability (STD). Manulife Financial administers/insures this benefit.
  You will not qualify for Basic LTD benefits until you have:

- been on an approved disability leave for 17 weeks (this is referred to as the LTD elimination period), and

- been approved by the administrator/insurer for Basic LTD benefits.
  For more details on the Disability Program, refer to myHR > Benefits & Life Changes > Benefits > Disability Programs.
  Your options
  The myBenefits program provides a company-paid Basic LTD benefit (taxable). The Basic benefit equals 70% of your benefit earnings, to a maximum benefit of $2,333 per month. You will reach the benefit maximum if your benefit earnings are greater than $40,000 a year.
  If you require additional disability insurance coverage above what Techcom pays for under the myBenefits [program (Basic LTD), you will need to obtain an individual insurance policy, either with Techcom Insurance, or another insurance provider of your choice. Details about the coverage available from Techcom Insurance and the process by which you can obtain this coverage if eligible, is available on the](https:// techcom.com/hr/discounts/index.page) [Employee](https:// techcom.com/hr/discounts/index.page) Discounts [section on myHR. If you have an individual optional long term disability insurance policy with Techcom Insurance, you must notify Techcom Insurance to discuss the options for your policy when you cease full-time employment. As this policy is individually purchased and paid for, it will not automatically terminate when you leave Techcom. You can do so by calling 1-855-831-8192 or email](mailto:LTDTop-up@rbc.com) [LTDTop-up@rbc.com](mailto:LTDTop-up@rbc.com)[.](mailto:LTDTop-up@rbc.com)
  We encourage you to review this information so that you can make an informed decision that meets your personal needs.
  Tax considerations
  Under current Canada Revenue Agency rules any LTD benefit payments you receive that stem from coverage
  paid for by the company will be taxed as employment income. As the premiums for Basic LTD coverage (i.e., coverage based on the first $40,000 of benefit earnings) are paid for by Techcom, any Basic LTD benefit payments you may receive will be taxed as employment income. Any LTD benefit payments you receive that stem from coverage paid for _by you_ will not be taxed. If you choose to obtain individual disability coverage above the Basic LTD
  coverage that is fully paid for by Techcom under the myBenefits program, we encourage you to review the tax implications for that particular policy.
  Defining disability
  You will be considered totally disabled if:

- during the first two years of your disability, you are unable to perform the essential duties of your own occupation; and

- after the first two years of your disability, you are unable to perform the duties of any occupation for which you are reasonably qualified by education, training or experience, _and_ you are unable to earn at least 75% of your pre-disability earnings.
  Your pre-disability benefit earnings are your benefit earnings on the last day you worked prior to Short Term Disability. The start date of your LTD disability effective date is generally after 17 weeks of approved Short Term Disability.

  Medical evidence?
  While on LTD, you may be asked periodically by the administrator or case manager to provide medical evidence to support that your disability prevents you from working. The information must be considered satisfactory to the administrator/case manager in order for your benefit payments to continue. If you need to provide medical evidence, you should ask your doctor(s) to supply detailed medical evidence documenting how your illness or injury prevents you from working as quickly as possible, so that benefit payments are not interrupted. If your doctor charges for this service, you will be responsible for paying the related fees.
  Note: Medical evidence may include but is not limited to details of your treatment plan, copies of relevant test results/investigative reports, copies of clinical notes, consult reports from specialists, a summary of observable physical findings, prognosis for recovery, and/or measurable clinical signs confirmed by a recognized physician with expertise in the area of the relevant medical condition(s) that are preventing you from working.
  You may also be asked to attend a medical examination conducted by a medical professional scheduled by the administrator/case manager. Failure to undergo a medical and/or psychological examination requested by the administrator/case manager may result in the termination of benefit payments and you may be required to pay the missed appointment charge.
  Integration of benefits
  Any Basic LTD benefit you receive will be immediately reduced by:

- any ongoing commissions or other earnings you receive from the company. Vacation pay accrued and commission earned prior to the Long Term Disability Benefit commencement date are not considered an offset;

- any benefits payable under a provincial workers’ compensation or similar program;

- benefits received from the Canada/Quebec Pension Plan (excluding benefits paid on behalf of your eligible dependants or resulting from cost-of-living adjustments);

- disability and income replacement benefits payable under any government plan (excluding Employer Insurance Benefits);

- retirement benefits provided by any employer or government program;

- earnings recovered as damages from a person or corporation (under the provisions of Third Party Liability);

- income or benefits payable under:

  - a plan sponsored by an association, union or fraternal organization to which you belong; or
  - any automobile insurance plan (where the reduction is not prohibited by law); and

- income from any self-employment earnings.

If you receive Basic LTD benefit payments in excess of what should have been paid, the administrator/insurer reserves the right to recover the excess from you, or to deduct it from future Basic LTD benefit payments. These payments must be communicated by you to Manulife Financial as soon as you are made aware of them.

Applying for Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and/or Quebec Pension Plan (QPP)

Employees on approved LTD are required to apply for CPP/QPP disability benefits. An application for CPP/QPP is to be made after you have been on approved LTD for one year or earlier in the situations where the prognosis indicates that it is very unlikely that you will return from disability after one year. Benefits received from CPP/QPP are applied as a direct offset to the LTD benefit.

There are several advantages for you to be in receipt of CPP/QPP disability benefits while receiving LTD benefits:

1. There is an annual cost of living increase allowed on CPP/QPP disability benefits which is not offset from the LTD benefit, i.e., Manulife will only offset the initial award amount from CPP.
2. Once approved for CPP/QPP benefits you are no longer required to make contributions to the plan(s) and your CPP/ QPP retirement benefit will be based on your contributions up to that point in time and you will not be penalized for not contributing to CPP/QPP.
3. If you are in receipt of CPP/QPP disability benefits at the time of your death, CPP/QPP Survivor’s benefits will be paid.

Manulife Financial will provide you with information and assistance when it is time to apply for CPP/QPP benefit. You must advise your Manulife Case Manager with the outcome of your CPP/QPP application providing the date it is approved or declined.

Cost of living adjustments?

There is no cost of living adjustment under the Basic LTD benefit.

Rehabilitation Program

One of the main objectives of the Basic LTD Plan is to help you get back to a productive lifestyle as quickly as possible. That’s why the myBenefits Basic LTD Plan includes a Rehabilitation Program. Participation in a Rehabilitation Program must be approved by the administrator/insurer.

If you participate in a Rehabilitation Program and receive associated employment earnings, your regular

benefit payments will be reduced by 50% of your rehabilitation employment earnings. In addition, your benefit payment will be reduced by the amount that your total income from all sources exceeds 100% of your pre-disability benefit earnings.

Benefit payments will stop altogether once your rehabilitation income reaches 75% of your normal pre- disability benefit earnings or after two years, whichever comes first. You can be on a rehabilitation program for a maximum of 24 months.

Recurrent disability

If you resume working your regular hours after a period of disability, but become disabled again within six months due to the same or a related cause, the second period of disability will be considered a continuation of the

previous period. Your Basic LTD benefits will, subject to approval, resume immediately – you do not have to satisfy another elimination period.

If the recurrence occurs more than six months following the previous disability, it will be treated as a new disability. In this case, you must satisfy the elimination period again (17 weeks of approved STD) before Basic LTD benefits resume and you must also be re-approved for benefits.

If you return to active employment after a period of disability and become disabled again due to an unrelated cause, you will have to satisfy the elimination period again.

If you do not qualify for Basic LTD benefits

If RBC’s administrator/insurer (Manulife) determines that you do not qualify for Basic LTD benefits, you are expected to return to work. Until you return to work, your absence may:

- be considered unauthorized by Techcom;

- result in the discontinuance of any further income payment;

- have an effect on your eligibility for other benefits, including disability benefits in respect of any new illness or injury; and

- have an effect on you or your dependants’ eligibility for accidental death & dismemberment benefits or critical illness.
  Premium deductions during a leave\*
  Under the myBenefits program, during your leave regular premiums will be deducted from your payroll bank account corresponding to your payroll cycle (bi-weekly, semi-monthly, or monthly). Healthcare and insurance premiums are based on the coverage selected and the rates in effect. Funds for these deductions must be in your bank account in order for coverage to be effective. Should no funds be available in your bank account, coverage is at risk of being terminated.
  What the plan does not cover
  Basic LTD benefits are not payable for any of the following:

- Any period during which you are not under, and complying with, the continuous active care and treatment of a qualified physician.

- Any period during which you are:

  - imprisoned or confined in a similar institution,
  - on maternity leave (as allowed by law or agreed to by Techcom), or
  - in receipt of (or qualify for) Employment Insurance maternity benefits. \* _For Techcom employees who commenced their approved LTD leave prior to July 1, 2012, and RBCIS employees who commenced their approved LTD leave prior to July 1, 2013, Techcom covers the cost of any premiums for employees on an approved Long-Term Disability (LTD) leave, except costs associated with Critical Illness coverage._

- Any disability that is the result of:?

  - a self-inflicted bodily injury or sickness;
  - committing or attempting to commit an assault or criminal offence;
  - insurrection or war (declared or not);
  - active service in the armed forces;
  - participation in any riot, civil commotion or any other act of aggression;
  - any occupation or paid employment other than for Techcom; or
  - medical or surgical care that is not medically necessary, such as cosmetic surgery.

- A disability that is the result of drug or alcohol abuse, unless confined in hospital or participating in a Rehabilitation Program that has been approved by the administrator/insurer.

- When an employee is on lay-off during which time the Employee becomes Totally Disabled.
  Maternity leaves
  Basic LTD benefits are not payable while you are on maternity leave. However, if you were receiving Basic LTD benefits immediately prior to the start of your maternity leave, benefits will resume immediately following your leave – provided you are still disabled.
  If you are pregnant and receiving Basic LTD benefits for an illness that is not pregnancy-related, Basic LTD benefits continue until the date you are scheduled to return to work. Maternity leave may then begin, provided it does not extend beyond 18 weeks following the date of delivery.
  Continuing coverage
  While you are on LTD:

- your Core benefit coverage will continue at no cost to you;

- you will continue to receive your myBenefits credits;

- your Optional coverage (e.g., Healthcare, Optional Life, AD&D and Critical Illness) will continue subject to your continued payment of the associated premiums.
  You cannot increase any of your benefit coverages under the myBenefits program while on LTD. There are exceptions to this rule. If you have an eligible change event that affects the make-up of your family
  (e.g., a marriage, divorce, birth, etc.), you can adjust your “class” of family coverage under the Health Plans within 60 days of the event taking place.
  Under the myBenefits program regular premiums will be deducted from your payroll bank account corresponding to your payroll cycle (bi-weekly, semi-monthly or monthly). Healthcare and insurance premiums are
  based on the coverage selected and the rates in effect. Funds for these deductions must be in your bank account in order for coverage to be effective. Should no funds be available in your bank account, coverage is at risk of being terminated.
  When benefit payments stop
  An LTD plan year will end – and Basic LTD benefit payments will stop – when you recover, no longer qualify for benefits (including failure to participate or meet the required qualifications), retire, the end of the month during which you turn 65, or upon your death… whichever comes first.
  When coverage ends
  Under the myBenefits program, your Basic LTD coverage will end when your employment with the company ends, you reach age 65 less the qualifying period, retire, or upon your death… whichever comes first.
  Additional coverage
  If you have disability coverage with another provider, you are still expected to participate in the adjudication process with RBC’s provider, Manulife Financial. Otherwise, your leave may not be authorized by Techcom.

  # Accident insurance?

  The myBenefits program offers two important accident benefits:

- Business Travel Accident Insurance (Techcom Insurance — Policy GTA3090), and

- Accidental Death & Dismemberment (AD&D) Insurance (Manulife — Policy 39150).
  Business Travel Accident
  You are automatically enrolled for Business Travel Accident (BTA) insurance. It is one of your Core, company-paid benefits.
  Business Travel Accident insurance covers you if you are involved in an accident while performing the duties of your job, including travelling on company business. It also covers your spouse/partner and your eligible dependent child(ren) if, with the written approval of the company, they are travelling with you on company business.
  Business Travel Accident insurance includes everything from local business-related errands to business trips out of Canada. It does not include commuting to and from work.
  Amount of BTA benefit
  [The amount you (or your beneficiary or estate) will receive depends on the nature and extent of loss (refer to the “Loss-of-use payments” chart on](#bookmark100) page 53), as well as the principal sum of your coverage. The principal sum is equal to three times your benefit earnings, rounded up to the next $1,000. (For an explanation of benefit earnings, refer to the _Glossary of Terms_ [on](#bookmark139) page 75.) The maximum principal sum is $300,000; the minimum principal sum
  is $100,000.
  In the case of an eligible spouse/partner, coverage is based on 60% of your coverage. In the case of dependent child(ren), the maximum benefit that will be paid is $10,000.
  Accidental Death & Dismemberment
  Accidental Death & Dismemberment insurance (AD&D) gives you an easy and affordable way to provide your family with additional financial protection.
  You can purchase coverage for yourself, your spouse/partner, and/or your dependent child(ren).
  Your options
  You can purchase coverage up to $500,000 for you and/or your spouse/partner, and up to $100,000 for your dependent child(ren).
  The amount of coverage you buy is known as the principal sum. For example, if you buy five units of coverage for yourself, your principal sum would be $250,000 (5 x $50,000 = $250,000). Except where an accident results in irrevocable quadriplegia, paraplegia, hemiplegia, the loss of sight in both eyes, or the loss of both speech and hearing, the maximum benefit payable is equal to the principal sum.

  | In addition to the coverage outlined above, the Business Travel Accident and AD&D Plans provide you and your covered family members with a range of additional benefits. These valuable benefits are summarized below:                                                 |
  | Permanent and total disability (BTA only)                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
  | You receive 100% of the Principal Sum\* if you (or a covered family member) are injured in an accident which results in permanent and total disability within 365 days of the accident. Permanent and total disability must exist for 12                               |
  | consecutive months and prevent you from engaging in any occupation or employment for which you are fitted by reason of education, training or experience for the rest of your life.                                                                                    |
  | Permanent and total disability (AD&D only)                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
  | If, as a direct result of an accidental injury, a person becomes Permanently and Totally Disabled while insured for this Benefit, Manulife Financial will pay the Permanent and Total Disability benefit shown in the Loss-of-use-payments chart on page 53, provided: |

  1. he person becomes Permanently and Totally Disabled within 365 days after the date of the accidental injury; and
  2. the person has been Permanently and Totally Disabled for a continuous period of 12 months and remains so disabled at the end of such period.
     Repatriation benefit (available under both plans)
     If you (or a covered family member) die as the result of an accident that occurs more than 50 kilometres (BTA)/150 kilometres (AD&D) from home, both plans will cover the costs related to preparing and shipping the body to your city of residence. The maximum benefit payable is $10,000. In addition (BTA only), the benefit may include the cost of transportation, lodging and boarding for an immediate family member who is required to identify the body.
     Family transportation (BTA only)
     If you are injured in an accident for which a loss becomes payable under the Business Travel Accident Plan, and you are confined in a hospital at least 100 kilometres away from home, the plan will cover accommodation and transportation cost for an immediate family member to be with you (as recommended by the attending physician). The maximum benefit payable is $10,000. If transportation is by private vehicle, travelling expenses are limited to $0.20 per kilometre travelled.
     The plan does not cover ordinary living, travel or clothing expenses. \* Under BTA insurance, 100% of the Principal Sum is less any other amount paid under the Loss-of-Use Payments. \* You can elect different coverage amounts for yourself, your spouse/partner or your child(ren). However, coverage for your spouse/partner or child(ren) cannot exceed the coverage for yourself.
     ACCIDENTAL DEATH & DISMEMBERMENT — POLICY 39150

- is enrolled as a full-time student in any institution of higher learning beyond the secondary school level, or

- is attending secondary school and subsequently enrols as a full-time student in an institution of higher learning within one year of the date of the accident.
  The special education benefit is payable annually for up to four consecutive years, but only if the dependent child continues his or her education as a full-time student in an institution of higher learning.
  If you have dependent children who at the time of your death are not eligible for the education benefit, a lump sum will be paid to your beneficiary. Under BTA insurance, the lump sum will equal 1% of your principal sum (up to $2,500); under the AD&D Plan, it will equal $1,500.

  Payment amounts?
  Amounts payable under the Business Travel Accident (BTA) and AD&D insurance plans will depend on the nature and extent of the injury. The Loss-of-use payments table below outlines the percentage of the principal sum that will be paid out, depending on the plan and injury.

In the case of BTA insurance, coverage is also excluded when the aircraft is owned, leased, or operated by the covered individual or another member of the household.

Continuing coverage

While on STD or Basic LTD, your coverage under the BTA insurance plan will be suspended. However, you can continue your AD&D coverage. In the case of your AD&D coverage, you must continue to pay your premiums while you are on STD or Basic LTD. While receiving STD or Basic LTD benefits, you cannot increase your AD&D coverage. However, you can reduce or cancel your coverage.

When coverage ends

Under the myBenefits program, your BTA insurance will end when your employment with the company ends, you retire, or upon your death… whichever comes first.

Under the myBenefits program, your AD&D insurance will end when your employment with the company ends, you retire, you turn 70, or upon your death… whichever comes first. Spousal insurance will end when your coverage ends.

Insurance for a dependent child will end when your coverage ends or when the child no longer qualifies as a dependant… whichever comes first.

# Critical Illness insurance

Critical Illness insurance (Sun Life — Policy 50088) is a benefit that helps guard against the financial consequences of a serious, life-altering illness. The purpose of the benefit is to help you deal with any loss of income, medical costs, home modifications or career changes stemming from your illness. Under this plan, your protection doesn’t end after your first claim. You will continue to have coverage until you receive a benefit payment for a second, unrelated, covered condition.

Your options

You can elect Critical Illness insurance for yourself, your spouse/partner and your dependent child(ren). The benefit amount will be paid as a lump-sum payment if the covered individual is diagnosed after the effective date of coverage

with a covered critical illness, survives the survival period and the claim is approved by the insurer, Sun Life Financial.

1. [You can elect different options for yourself, your spouse/partner or your child(ren). Evidence of insurability is required for coverage over $75,000 –see page](#bookmark18) [13 for details. Coverage may be affected by a pre-existing medical condition – see page](#bookmark117) 65 for details.
2. [Coverage for you and your spouse/partner ends upon your retirement, but can be converted to an individual plan – see page](#bookmark119) 66 for portability privilege.
3. [Effective July 1, 2014, the Enhanced Child(ren) option provides coverage for childhood-onset illnesses – see page](#bookmark113) 63 for a list of covered conditions. The Basic option was closed to new entrants effective July 1, 2014. If you are currently enrolled for the Basic option, your coverage will continue. However, if you enrol for the Enhanced option, you cannot revert back to the Basic option. If you enrol in Child(ren) Critical Illness for the first time, you can only elect the Enhanced option.

Benefits will always be paid to the employee, even if they relate to coverage for spouse/partner or child.

How it works

You will receive a critical illness benefit payment if you meet the following conditions:

1. Your coverage is in effect.

2. You are diagnosed with or have surgery for a covered condition.

3. You survive a period of time (typically 30 or 90 days) after the date of diagnosis.

4. Sun Life, the insurer, approves your claim.

   After this first payment, you will continue to have coverage until you receive a benefit payment for a second, unrelated covered condition from a different category, outlined in the chart below. After the second payment, your coverage ends.

   Upon approval of claim, Sun Life will pay for up to 2 covered conditions for each covered person, subject to the following terms and conditions:

   - Once a benefit payment has been made for a covered condition, the person cannot make a claim for the same covered condition, or for another covered condition in the same category (refer to the table of categories below).
   - Once a benefit payment has been made for a covered condition, the person can make a claim for loss of independent existence only if the covered condition for which a benefit payment was made does not directly or indirectly cause loss of independent existence.
   - To claim for a second covered condition when the first benefit payment was not for cancer, there must be at least
     12 months between the date of diagnosis or surgery for the first covered condition and the date of diagnosis or surgery for the second covered condition.
   - To claim for a second covered condition when the first benefit payment was for cancer, there must be at least 12 months between:

     - the date of the last medical care or treatment related to cancer (including surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and palliative care but excluding routine screening, preventive medications and follow up visits with the physician), and
       Category 1
       Category 2
       Category 3
       Category 4
       Category 5
       \*Coverage for these conditions is not available for the Child(ren) Basic option.
       \*\*Coverage for these child-specific conditions is available for the Enhanced Child(ren) option only.
       \*\*\*Refer to _How it works_ for information about the eligibility of this condition once a benefit payment has been made for another covered condition.

Note: in the event of any discrepancies between this material and your Group Benefits contract, the language in your contract will take precedence. References to a covered person include children.

Critical Illness Child(ren) Enhanced option coverage may terminate for one child but continue for your other children.

Exclusions

All adult exclusions are applicable to children’s coverage.

Conversion

Conversion is available for Critical Illness Child(ren) Enhanced option coverage, same as the adult plan.

Limitations

Once two benefit payments have been made for the same person, that person’s coverage then terminates. Such person may not become covered again under this benefit and cannot re-elect Critical Illness insurance coverage at any time in the future.

Evidence of insurability?

Evidence of insurability (EOI) is required for all coverage amounts over $75,000 (employee and/or spouse/partner only). Coverage for amounts over $75,000 will be effective from the date EOI is approved by the insurer, not the date of election.

Smoker/non-smoker rates

Smokers pay more for their coverage than non-smokers. This reflects the fact that medical research indicates that, on average, non-smokers live longer and have fewer illnesses than smokers.

Under the terms of the myBenefits program, a non-smoker is anyone who has not used tobacco-related

products (including patches, nicotine chewing gum, etc.) for a full 12 months. A non-smoker cannot use tobacco related products during the plan year or coverage will be voided automatically.

If you (or your spouse/partner) indicate that you are a non-smoker and then start using tobacco-related products, you must update your smoker/non-smoker status immediately and switch to smoker rates – otherwise your Critical Illness coverage will be voided automatically. You can change your smoker/non-smoker status, using the myBenefits Enrolment System, which can be accessed from myHR > Benefits & Life Changes > Benefits.

Effective date

Any coverage for which evidence of insurability (EOI) is required will not go into effect until the date the EOI is approved by the insurance carrier. Once approval is received, your insurance premiums will be adjusted to reflect the new coverage amount.

If your spouse/partner or dependent child is in the hospital on the date Spousal or dependent Child(ren) Critical Illness coverage is due to begin, that coverage will not go into effect until the date following the last day of hospitalization. This requirement does not apply to a newborn child.

Once a child is covered for Child Critical Illness, any further children are automatically covered for this benefit.

What’s not covered

This benefit is not payable for claims resulting directly or indirectly from:

- intentionally self-inflicted injuries or attempted suicide, regardless of whether the person has a mental illness or intends or understands the consequences of their actions;
- the hostile action of any armed forces, insurrection, or participation in a riot or civil commotion;
- participation in a criminal offence;
- the use of illegal or illicit drugs or substances, misuse of drugs or alcohol;

Portability privilege

Should your Group Critical Illness insurance coverage terminate prior to age 65 for any reason other than your request, you may apply to transfer your coverage, within 31 days of termination, to a new critical illness insurance plan offered by Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada, up to a maximum of $100,000, without proof of good health, provided a critical illness benefit payment has not been made.

If your spouse's Group Critical Illness coverage ends for any reason other than your request, your spouse may apply to transfer the coverage to a new critical illness insurance plan offered by Sun Life, up to a maximum of $100,000, without proof of good health, provided a critical illness benefit payment has not been made for your spouse.

At the time that you and/or your spouse applies to transfer the Group Critical Illness coverage to a new critical illness insurance plan offered by Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada, you or your spouse may also apply to transfer the Group Critical Illness coverage for any of your covered children (available for the Enhanced Child(ren) option only), up to a maximum of $20,000, without proof of good health, provided a critical illness benefit payment has not been made for such child. However, if either you or your spouse maintains coverage under this plan, the Critical Illness coverage for your child cannot be transferred.

Please note that this group critical illness plan provides up to two benefit payments for each insured person. If an insured person transfers coverage to a new critical illness plan offered by Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada, they will only be eligible for one benefit payment.

Continuing coverage?

While on STD or LTD, your coverage under the Critical Illness insurance Plan can continue; however, you must continue to pay your premiums. You cannot increase your Critical Illness insurance coverage while on STD or LTD. However, you can reduce or cancel your coverage.

Changes in the amount of coverage

If a critical illness benefit payment has not been made, you may request an increase or a decrease in the coverage amount for you, your spouse or your child(ren), if any. Changes in the amount of child critical illness coverage will apply to all children.

If a benefit payment has been made for a covered person (you or your spouse), only decreases in such person’s amount of coverage are allowed.

You may request an increase or decrease in the amount of child optional critical illness coverage. If a benefit payment has been made for your child, decreases will apply to all of your children but increases will only apply to the children for whom a benefit payment has not been made.

If two benefit payments have been made for the same child, then such child’s coverage terminates. You may increase or decrease the amount of optional critical illness coverage for the remaining children covered under this plan

The Pre-existing conditions provision will apply to increased amounts of coverage.

Each covered person can claim up to 2 critical illness benefit payments. If your claim is paid for a second covered critical illness, your spouse/partner’s and/or your child’s coverage continues with premium payment. If your spouse/ partner’s claim is paid for a second covered critical illness, your spouse/partner’s coverage ends, and your and/or your child’s coverage continues with premium payment. If your child’s claim is paid for a second covered critical illness, that child’s coverage ends. However, your coverage, your spouse/partner’s coverage and any other child’s coverage continues with premium payment.

Please note: Following payment of your (or your eligible dependant's) second claim to the plan, any premiums paid will be refunded to the lesser of your date of diagnosis or 12 months.

- You will need to indicate the policy contract number on the claim form (that number is 152878).
  Tax treatment
  Your myBenefits plan reimburses the eligible expenses incurred by the surrogate directly to you. At this time, the claims paid to you under this plan constitute a taxable benefit for income tax purposes, such that the requisite source deductions (income tax, CPP/QPP, EI) will be applied to your regular pay 3-8 weeks following the claim reimbursement through Sun Life, depending on your pay frequency (bi-weekly, semi-monthly, monthly).
  The amount of source deductions is based on your marginal tax rate (combined federal and provincial) as well as any applicable CPP/QPP/EI deductions. For example, if your marginal tax rate is 40% and the claim amount being reimbursed is $20,000, the approximate amount being deducted from your regular pay would be $8,000 plus any applicable CPP/QPP and EI deductions.
  If the amount deducted exceeds your net pay for that period (bi-weekly, semi-monthly, monthly), any outstanding amount will be automatically deducted from your bank account at that time. To better understand the source deductions that are applicable to you, please speak with your tax advisor and plan accordingly before you submit any expenses to Sun Life for reimbursement.

   Custom-made orthotics and orthopaedic shoes

   Claims for custom-made orthotics and orthopaedic shoes must include all of the following:

   - A written recommendation (i.e., prescription) for the custom-made orthopaedic shoes or orthotics from an eligible prescribing healthcare practitioner _(note: a new written recommendation must be submitted with each claim and must include the diagnosis necessitating the custom-made orthopaedic shoes or orthotics)_;
   - A detailed lab invoice which provides an itemized breakdown of the raw materials used, their cost, and any other associated costs incurred to manufacture the custom-made orthopaedic shoes
     or orthotics _(note: if there are costs related to shoe modifications, the details and cost of each modification must be included on lab invoice)_; and
   - A receipt showing full payment has been made, patient’s name and date
     of service.
     When purchasing your custom-made orthopaedic shoes or
     orthotics, ask your provider for the items listed above at the time you pick up and pay for your shoes or orthotics. Claims submitted without each item listed above will be declined.
     Prescription drugs
     Pay-direct drug card
     For drug coverage under the managed formulary, a pay-direct drug (PDD) card is provided for coverage for:
   - Coordination and Comprehensive; and
   - Core, once you reach the $3,000/family Drugs & Medical out-of-pocket maximum.
     [If you require additional copies of a PDD card for a covered eligible dependant (i.e., a spouse/partner or dependent child), you can print a copy from the Sun Life website (](http://www.mysunlife.ca/)www.mysunlife.ca) or download the my Sun Life Mobile app for an electronic version of the PDD card.
     A PDD card enables your pharmacist to verify your coverage for prescription drugs and process drug claims on the spot. The pharmacist will bill the plan directly for all eligible expenses. You pay only the portion of your drug bill that isn’t covered.
     Keep in mind that not all drug expenses can be processed with your PDD card. Refer to the list of eligible expenses in _Drugs and Medical_ [on page](#bookmark46) 27 for details.
     To find out if the prescribed drug is covered under the managed formulary use the Drug Look-up feature available at
     www.mysunlife.ca or through the my Sun Life Mobile app to search a drug name or drug identification number (DIN).
     Drugs and Medical Plan – maintenance drug request
     The payment for a single purchase of an acute prescription drug (e.g. antibiotics) is limited to a maximum of a 34-day supply.
     If you are taking the acute drug on an ongoing basis, you may request the maximum limit be extended to a 100-day supply by completing a Maintenance drug request form and sending it to Sun Life for approval. The form is available at myHR > Benefits & Life Changes > Benefits > Forms & Contacts. Both you and Techcom will benefit from being charged a single dispensing fee or a reduced flat rate rather than the full dispensing fee each month.
     Specialty drugs requiring Prior Authorization
     Claims for certain specialty drugs\* require pre-approval by Sun Life in order to be approved for reimbursement. Refer to
     Drugs and Medical Plan on page 30 for more information about the Prior Authorization process for specialty drugs.
     Integration with provincial drug programs
     Your pharmacists will advise you if a drug is available through a provincial program and will instruct you to have your doctor complete an application. Sun Life will also provide you with a letter with instructions. Once you are approved for the provincial drug program, you will be required to advise your pharmacist of your approval for the program.
     Submitting a claim
     To be eligible for reimbursement, expenses must be claimed within one year from the date incurred, or within 90 days of terminating your employment with the company – whichever comes first.
     Dental (25368)?
     Claims can be submitted electronically, via e-claim or using paper-based forms. If your dentist has electronic access to the Sun Life claims system, he or she can submit a claim on your behalf. You will need to tell your dentist the plan contract number (that number is 25368).
     [If your dentist submits the claim electronically, you will have the option for Sun Life to pay the eligible portion of the dental expense directly to your dentist and you will only have to pay for the portion of the claim that is not covered by the dental plan. If your dentist does not have electronic claim filing you can submit the claim directly to Sun Life electronically – see the instructions under e-claims, on](#bookmark123) page 75.
     [You can submit a paper-based form by printing a personalized claim form from the Sun Life website at](https://www.mysunlife.ca/) www.mysunlife.ca. Alternatively, a Standard Dental Claim Form can be used, but you must be sure to write the plan policy number (that number is 25368) and your employee number on the form. Paper-based claim forms should be mailed directly to the Sun Life office on the claim form.
     Reimbursements will be deposited in your payroll account. If you do not have an Techcom payroll account, a cheque will be mailed to you instead. You, in turn, must pay the dentist. Sun Life will not send the reimbursement to your dentist.
     Sun Life will send you an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) that you can use for the coordination of benefits. Claims must be submitted within one year of the date the expense is incurred. If you end your employment or retire with Techcom, you must claim all outstanding expenses within 90 days.
     Emergency Out-of-Province/Country Medical & Travel Assistance
     Call the number below for assistance with your claim after it has been submitted:
   - Claims Customer Service: 1-877-330-6601 (toll-free from U.S. or Canada)
     To request medical assistance and consultation, payment assistance or to contact the Emergency Message Centre, at anytime, please call:
   - 1-866-496-5254 (toll-free from U.S. or Canada)

   - 1-905-813-4719 (fax)

If you have returned home from your trip as a result of an emergency medical condition, you will need to submit an Emergency Medical insurance claim to Allianz Global Assistance at P.O. Box 277, Waterloo, ON, N2J 4A4. See myHR > Benefits & Life Changes > Benefits > Forms & Contacts.

Health Spending Account (25365)

[You can submit Health Spending Account (HSA) claims directly to Sun Life electronically (see the instructions on page](#bookmark129) 69 under e-claims).

[If you prefer, you can print out a personalized claim form from the Sun Life website, at](https://www.mysunlife.ca/) www.mysunlife.ca. If you have access to coverage under other benefit plans, you must submit claims to those plans first.

The remaining portion of a health or dental expense can be claimed under the Health Spending Account. If you don’t have coverage under any other plans, simply tick the appropriate box on the claim form and the unpaid portion will be withdrawn from your HSA account and deposited in your payroll account.

Once Sun Life processes your electronic claim, reimbursements will be deposited in your payroll account. Sun Life will email you a copy of your Explanation of Benefits (EOB) that will report the balance remaining in your HSA. You can elect a “paper” EOB from the Sun Life site, which will be mailed to you once your claim has been processed.

Claims for expenses incurred before your employment ended must be submitted within 90 days of your termination or retirement date to be eligible for reimbursement.

Wellness Account?

[All you need is a Wellness Account Claim Form, which you print, complete, and submit to Sun Life. You can obtain this form at myHR > Benefits & Life Changes > Benefits > Forms & Contacts. Wellness Account claims can be submitted as paper claim forms, or they can be scanned and emailed to Sun Life for processing to](mailto:myclaims@sunlife.com) myclaims@sunlife.com. The form contains the full list of the expenses covered by your Wellness Account, along with any special criteria for eligibility. You can see at a glance if an item or service is eligible. Just check off each expense category under which you want to submit a claim and complete the rest of the form.

While scanning and emailing your claim is the most efficient way to submit a Wellness claim, if you wish you can also submit your paper claim form with an original receipt or other original proof of payment for every item claimed. The receipt or proof of payment must clearly outline the type of expense and amount you are claiming as well as the date the expense was incurred.

Some receipts may be more difficult to obtain than others. For example, a fitness club membership is typically paid monthly through automatic bank withdrawals or credit card payments. In this case, as proof of payment, you may submit a bank statement, if the type of expense is clearly indicated and the statement itself is identifiable as relating to your bank account or, if you prefer, ask your fitness club or service provider for a valid receipt.

Your claim form should be emailed or mailed directly to the Sun Life office on the claim form. Be sure to save a copy for your own files. Reimbursements will be deposited in your payroll account. Sun Life will send you an Explanation of Benefits (EOB). The EOB will report the balance remaining in your Wellness Account. You can elect a “paperless” EOB from the Sun Life site, which will be e-mailed to you once your claim has been processed.

Please note that the plan year runs from July 1 to June 30. The deadline to submit your claim is 90 days after the end of the plan year in which your claim was incurred.

Claims for expenses incurred before your employment ended must be submitted within 90 days of your termination or retirement date to be eligible for reimbursement.

Life and AD&D

In the event of a claim under the Basic Life, Optional Life, Accidental Death & Dismemberment or Business Travel Accident insurance Plans, write or fax HR Advice Canada, Transit 6605, 6880 Financial Drive, Mississauga, Ontario L5N 7Y5, Attention: Benefits Delivery. The fax number is: 1-888-309-4999.

You should write or fax as soon as possible, but no later than 90 days after the illness, injury or death for which a claim is being made.

Critical Illness insurance

In the event of a claim under the Critical Illness Plan, contact Sun Life at 1-800-305-5905.

You should contact Sun Life no later than 30 days after being diagnosed for any illness for which a claim is being made.

You should submit your proof of claim no later than 90 days from the date of diagnosis or surgery. Failure to give notice of claim or furnish proof of claim within the above time limits does not invalidate the claim if the notice or proof is given or furnished as soon as reasonably possible, and in no event later than one year from the date of diagnosis or surgery if it is shown that it was not reasonably possible to give notice or furnish proof within the above time limits.

If the medical records are not in French or English, the claimant must provide the original records along with an English or French translation of the records. The claimant is responsible for any cost associated with providing the translation.

Coordinating claims with your spouse/partner

If both you and your spouse/partner have health and/or dental coverage under a company-sponsored benefit program, you can coordinate your claims. In other words, you can claim payment for health or dental expenses under both plans. If both you and your spouse have coverage at Sun Life your coordination of benefits claims may be processed instantly

[on-line on the Sun Life website](http://www.mysunlife.ca/) www.mysunlife.ca[. For more detail on e-claims see page 69.](#bookmark129)

- You must first submit claims for yourself through the myBenefits program. Any unpaid personal claims can then be submitted through your spouse’s/partner’s plan.

- If your spouse/partner has coverage through a group plan, your spouse/partner must submit personal claims through his or her company’s plan first. If that plan doesn’t cover the full cost of the service or procedure, you can claim the remaining expense through the myBenefits program.

- Claims for dependent children are to be submitted first to the plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in the year. If you were born in March, for example, and your spouse/partner was born in July, you would submit claims for dependent children to the myBenefits program first. Again, any uncovered expenses could, in turn, be submitted to your spouse’s/partner’s plan as a secondary payer.
  _**Important:**_ if you have a change to your covered dependants (e.g., if you get married, or your child becomes ineligible for benefits) make sure you update your coverage level and class within 60 days of the event using the myBenefits Enrolment System at [http://](http:// techcom.com/meandrbc/cid-125907.html) techcom.com/meandrbc/cid-125907.html.
  In situations where you and your spouse/partner are separated or divorced, you should seek reimbursement from benefit plans in the following order:

- the plan of the parent with custody of the child,

- the plan of the spouse/partner of the parent with custody,

- the plan of the parent without custody,

- the plan of the spouse/partner of the parent without custody.
  In situations where you belong to two or more separate plans (e.g., you are an employee at two organizations and have coverage at both), your claims should be submitted in the following order:

- the plan where you are an active full-time employee,

- the plan where you are an active part-time employee,

- the plan where you are a retiree.
  In no case can the total reimbursement you (and your spouse/partner) receive exceed 100% of the actual expense you (or your spouse/partner) incurred. With that in mind, you might want to consider reducing your Paramedical and Vision, Drugs and Medical, and/or Dental coverage and costs under the myBenefits program if you have coverage under another plan.
  Reducing your coverage may make sense if the cost of coverage under the myBenefits program would not warrant the additional amounts you can claim on a coordinated basis.
